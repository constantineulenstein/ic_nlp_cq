            "['[Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen 1811]', 'CHAPTER 1', 'The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.', 'Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park,', 'in the centre of their property, where, for many generations,', 'they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage', 'the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance.', 'The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived', 'to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life,', 'had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.', 'But her death, which happened ten years before his own,', 'produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply', 'her loss, he invited and received into his house the family', 'of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor', 'of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended', 'to bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece,', \"and their children, the old Gentleman's days were\", 'comfortably spent.  His attachment to them all increased.', 'The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood', 'to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest,', 'but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid', 'comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness', 'of the children added a relish to his existence.', 'By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one', 'son: by his present lady, three daughters.  The son,', 'a steady respectable young man, was amply provided', 'for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,', 'and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.', 'By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards,', 'he added to his wealth.  To him therefore the succession', 'to the Norland estate was not so really important as to', 'his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might', \"arise to them from their father's inheriting that property,\", 'could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their', 'father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal;', \"for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was\", 'also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest', 'in it.', 'The old gentleman died: his will was read, and', 'like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment', 'as pleasure.  He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful,', 'as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him', 'on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest.', 'Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his', 'wife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to', \"his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old,\", 'it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself', 'no power of providing for those who were most dear', 'to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge', 'on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.', 'The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who,', 'in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland,', 'had so far gained on the affections of his uncle,', 'by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children', 'of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation,', 'an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks,', 'and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value', 'of all the attention which, for years, he had received', 'from his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to', 'be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection', 'for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.', \"Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe;\", 'but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might', 'reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically,', 'lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate', 'already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement.', 'But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his', 'only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer;', 'and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies,', 'was all that remained for his widow and daughters.', 'His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known,', 'and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength', 'and urgency which illness could command, the interest', 'of his mother-in-law and sisters.', 'Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the', 'rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation', 'of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do', 'every thing in his power to make them comfortable.', 'His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,', 'and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how', 'much there might prudently be in his power to do for them.', 'He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to', 'be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be', 'ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected;', 'for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge', 'of his ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman,', 'he might have been made still more respectable than he', 'was:--he might even have been made amiable himself; for he', 'was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife.', 'But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;--', 'more narrow-minded and selfish.', 'When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated', 'within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters', 'by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece.  He then', 'really thought himself equal to it.  The prospect of four', 'thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,', \"besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune,\", 'warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.--', '\"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would', 'be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make', 'them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he could', 'spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\"--', 'He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively,', 'and he did not repent.', \"No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John\", 'Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her', 'mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants.', 'No one could dispute her right to come; the house was', \"her husband's from the moment of his father's decease;\", 'but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater,', \"and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only\", 'common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--', 'but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen,', 'a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind,', 'by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source', 'of immoveable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never', \"been a favourite with any of her husband's family;\", 'but she had had no opportunity, till the present,', 'of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort', 'of other people she could act when occasion required it.', 'So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious', 'behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her', 'daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter,', 'she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the', 'entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect', 'on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all', 'her three children determined her afterwards to stay,', 'and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.', 'Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was', 'so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,', 'and coolness of judgment, which qualified her,', 'though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother,', 'and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage', 'of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood', 'which must generally have led to imprudence.  She had', 'an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate,', 'and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern', 'them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;', 'and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.', \"Marianne's abilities were, in many respects,\", \"quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever;\", 'but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have', 'no moderation.  She was generous, amiable, interesting: she', 'was everything but prudent.  The resemblance between', 'her and her mother was strikingly great.', 'Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her', \"sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued\", 'and cherished.  They encouraged each other now in the', 'violence of their affliction.  The agony of grief', 'which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed,', 'was sought for, was created again and again.  They gave', 'themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase', 'of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it,', 'and resolved against ever admitting consolation', 'in future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still', 'she could struggle, she could exert herself.  She could', 'consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law', 'on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;', 'and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion,', 'and encourage her to similar forbearance.', 'Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored,', 'well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed', \"a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having\", 'much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair', 'to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.', 'CHAPTER 2', 'Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress', 'of Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded', 'to the condition of visitors.  As such, however, they were', 'treated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband', 'with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody', 'beyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really', 'pressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland', 'as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible', 'to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could', 'accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood,', 'his invitation was accepted.', 'A continuance in a place where everything reminded', 'her of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind.', 'In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful', 'than hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine', 'expectation of happiness which is happiness itself.', 'But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,', 'and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was', 'beyond alloy.', 'Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her', 'husband intended to do for his sisters.  To take three', 'thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy', 'would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree.', 'She begged him to think again on the subject.  How could', 'he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only', 'child too, of so large a sum?  And what possible claim', 'could the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by', 'half blood, which she considered as no relationship at all,', 'have on his generosity to so large an amount.  It was very', 'well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist', 'between the children of any man by different marriages;', 'and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry,', 'by giving away all his money to his half sisters?', '\"It was my father\\'s last request to me,\" replied', 'her husband, \"that I should assist his widow and daughters.\"', '\"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say;', 'ten to one but he was light-headed at the time.', 'Had he been in his right senses, he could not have thought', 'of such a thing as begging you to give away half your', 'fortune from your own child.\"', '\"He did not stipulate for any particular sum,', 'my dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms,', 'to assist them, and make their situation more comfortable', 'than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it would', 'have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.', 'He could hardly suppose I should neglect them.', 'But as he required the promise, I could not do less', 'than give it; at least I thought so at the time.', 'The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.', 'Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland', 'and settle in a new home.\"', '\"Well, then, LET something be done for them;', 'but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds.', 'Consider,\" she added, \"that when the money is once', 'parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters will marry,', 'and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could', 'be restored to our poor little boy--\"', '\"Why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely,', '\"that would make great difference.  The time may come when', 'Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with.', 'If he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would', 'be a very convenient addition.\"', '\"To be sure it would.\"', '\"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties,', 'if the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds', 'would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!\"', '\"Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth', 'would do half so much for his sisters, even if REALLY', 'his sisters!  And as it is--only half blood!--But you', 'have such a generous spirit!\"', '\"I would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied.', '\"One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than', 'too little.  No one, at least, can think I have not', 'done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly', 'expect more.\"', '\"There is no knowing what THEY may expect,\"', 'said the lady, \"but we are not to think of their', 'expectations: the question is, what you can afford to do.\"', '\"Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five', 'hundred pounds a-piece.  As it is, without any addition', 'of mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds', \"on their mother's death--a very comfortable fortune\", 'for any young woman.\"', '\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that', 'they can want no addition at all.  They will have ten', 'thousand pounds divided amongst them.  If they marry,', 'they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not,', 'they may all live very comfortably together on the interest', 'of ten thousand pounds.\"', '\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether,', 'upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do', 'something for their mother while she lives, rather than', 'for them--something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters', 'would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.', 'A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"', 'His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving', 'her consent to this plan.', '\"To be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with', 'fifteen hundred pounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood', 'should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in.\"', '\"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot', 'be worth half that purchase.\"', '\"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always', 'live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them;', 'and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.', 'An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over', 'and over every year, and there is no getting rid', 'of it.  You are not aware of what you are doing.', 'I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities;', 'for my mother was clogged with the payment of three', \"to old superannuated servants by my father's will,\", 'and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.', 'Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then', 'there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one', 'of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned', 'out to be no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.', 'Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual', 'claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father,', 'because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at', \"my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.\", 'It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am', 'sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for', 'all the world.\"', '\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood,', '\"to have those kind of yearly drains on one\\'s income.', \"One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one's own.\", 'To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,', 'on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away', 'one\\'s independence.\"', '\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.', 'They think themselves secure, you do no more than what', 'is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all.  If I were you,', 'whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely.', 'I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.', 'It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred,', 'or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"', '\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better', 'that there should by no annuity in the case; whatever I', 'may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance', 'than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge', 'their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income,', 'and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end', 'of the year.  It will certainly be much the best way.', 'A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent', 'their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think,', 'be amply discharging my promise to my father.\"', '\"To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth,', 'I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea', 'of your giving them any money at all.  The assistance', 'he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be', 'reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking', 'out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them', 'to move their things, and sending them presents of fish', 'and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season.', \"I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\", 'it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.', 'Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively', 'comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live', 'on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the', 'thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings', 'them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course,', 'they will pay their mother for their board out of it.', 'Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them,', 'and what on earth can four women want for more than', 'that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will', 'be nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses,', 'and hardly any servants; they will keep no company,', 'and can have no expenses of any kind!  Only conceive', 'how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a year! I am', 'sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it;', 'and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think', 'of it.  They will be much more able to give YOU something.\"', '\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you', 'are perfectly right.  My father certainly could mean', 'nothing more by his request to me than what you say.', 'I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil', 'my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness', 'to them as you have described.  When my mother removes', 'into another house my services shall be readily given', 'to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little present', 'of furniture too may be acceptable then.\"', '\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  \"But, however,', 'ONE thing must be considered.  When your father and mother', 'moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill', 'was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved,', 'and is now left to your mother.  Her house will therefore', 'be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"', '\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.', 'A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would', 'have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here.\"', '\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice', 'as handsome as what belongs to this house.  A great', 'deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY', 'can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.', 'Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this:', 'that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention', 'to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could,', 'he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM.\"', 'This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his', 'intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he', 'finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary,', 'if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow', 'and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly', 'acts as his own wife pointed out.', 'CHAPTER 3', 'Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months;', 'not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every', 'well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it', 'produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive,', 'and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that', 'of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances,', 'she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries', 'for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland;', 'for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.', 'But she could hear of no situation that at once answered', 'her notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence', 'of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected', 'several houses as too large for their income, which her', 'mother would have approved.', 'Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the', 'solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour,', 'which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections.', 'She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he', \"had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters'\", 'sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was', 'persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would', \"support her in affluence.  For their brother's sake, too,\", 'for the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she', 'reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before,', 'in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentive', 'behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that', 'their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time,', 'she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.', 'The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance,', 'felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased', 'by the farther knowledge of her character, which half', \"a year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps\", 'in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal', 'affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might', 'have found it impossible to have lived together so long,', 'had not a particular circumstance occurred to give', 'still greater eligibility, according to the opinions', \"of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.\", 'This circumstance was a growing attachment between', 'her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood,', 'a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced', \"to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment\", 'at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part', 'of his time there.', 'Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from', 'motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son', 'of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed', 'it from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum,', 'the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother.', 'But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration.', 'It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,', 'that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned', 'the partiality.  It was contrary to every doctrine of', \"her's that difference of fortune should keep any couple\", 'asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition;', \"and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged\", 'by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.', 'Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good', 'opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address.', 'He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy', 'to make them pleasing.  He was too diffident to do justice', 'to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,', 'his behaviour gave every indication of an open,', 'affectionate heart.  His understanding was good,', 'and his education had given it solid improvement.', 'But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition', 'to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed', 'to see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.', 'They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some', 'manner or other.  His mother wished to interest him in', 'political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see', 'him connected with some of the great men of the day.', 'Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while,', 'till one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would', 'have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche.', 'But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches.', 'All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet', 'of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brother', 'who was more promising.', 'Edward had been staying several weeks in the house', \"before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention;\", 'for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered', 'her careless of surrounding objects.  She saw only that he', 'was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.', 'He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by', 'ill-timed conversation.  She was first called to observe', 'and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor', 'chanced one day to make on the difference between him', 'and his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended him', 'most forcibly to her mother.', '\"It is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike', 'Fanny is enough.  It implies everything amiable.', 'I love him already.\"', '\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you', 'know more of him.\"', '\"Like him!\" replied her mother with a smile.', '\"I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love.\"', '\"You may esteem him.\"', '\"I have never yet known what it was to separate', 'esteem and love.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.', 'Her manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.', 'She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion', 'of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration;', 'but she really felt assured of his worth: and even that', 'quietness of manner, which militated against all her', \"established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be,\", 'was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be', 'warm and his temper affectionate.', 'No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love', 'in his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their', 'serious attachment as certain, and looked forward', 'to their marriage as rapidly approaching.', '\"In a few months, my dear Marianne.\" said she,', '\"Elinor will, in all probability be settled for life.', 'We shall miss her; but SHE will be happy.\"', '\"Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without her?\"', '\"My love, it will be scarcely a separation.', 'We shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall', 'meet every day of our lives.  You will gain a brother,', 'a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest opinion', \"in the world of Edward's heart.  But you look grave,\", 'Marianne; do you disapprove your sister\\'s choice?\"', '\"Perhaps,\" said Marianne, \"I may consider it', 'with some surprise.  Edward is very amiable, and I love', 'him tenderly.  But yet--he is not the kind of young', 'man--there is something wanting--his figure is not striking;', 'it has none of that grace which I should expect', 'in the man who could seriously attach my sister.', 'His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once', 'announce virtue and intelligence.  And besides all this,', 'I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste.  Music seems', \"scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's\", 'drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person', 'who can understand their worth.  It is evident, in spite of', 'his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact', 'he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as a lover,', 'not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters', 'must be united.  I could not be happy with a man whose', 'taste did not in every point coincide with my own.', 'He must enter into all my feelings; the same books,', 'the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how spiritless,', \"how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!\", 'I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it', 'with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.', 'I could hardly keep my seat.  To hear those beautiful lines', 'which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced', 'with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!\"--', '\"He would certainly have done more justice to', 'simple and elegant prose.  I thought so at the time;', 'but you WOULD give him Cowper.\"', '\"Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--', 'but we must allow for difference of taste.  Elinor has', 'not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and', 'be happy with him.  But it would have broke MY heart,', 'had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.', 'Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced', 'that I shall never see a man whom I can really love.', \"I require so much!  He must have all Edward's virtues,\", 'and his person and manners must ornament his goodness', 'with every possible charm.\"', '\"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.', 'It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness.', 'Why should you be less fortunate than your mother?  In', 'one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your destiny be', 'different from her\\'s!\"', 'CHAPTER 4', '\"What a pity it is, Elinor,\" said Marianne,', '\"that Edward should have no taste for drawing.\"', '\"No taste for drawing!\" replied Elinor, \"why should', 'you think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has', 'great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people,', 'and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste,', 'though he has not had opportunities of improving it.', 'Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would', 'have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment', 'in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling', 'to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate', 'propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general', 'direct him perfectly right.\"', 'Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more', 'on the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor', 'described as excited in him by the drawings of other', 'people, was very far from that rapturous delight, which,', 'in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though', 'smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured', 'her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.', '\"I hope, Marianne,\" continued Elinor, \"you do not', 'consider him as deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think', 'I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him', 'is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion,', 'I am sure you could never be civil to him.\"', 'Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would', 'not wound the feelings of her sister on any account,', 'and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible.', 'At length she replied:', '\"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him', 'is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.', 'I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter', 'propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes,', 'as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world', 'of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that is', 'worthy and amiable.\"', '\"I am sure,\" replied Elinor, with a smile,', '\"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied', 'with such commendation as that.  I do not perceive', 'how you could express yourself more warmly.\"', 'Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.', '\"Of his sense and his goodness,\" continued Elinor,', '\"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him', 'often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.', 'The excellence of his understanding and his principles', 'can be concealed only by that shyness which too often', 'keeps him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice', 'to his solid worth.  But of his minuter propensities,', 'as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances', 'been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I have', 'been at times thrown a good deal together, while you', 'have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate', 'principle by my mother.  I have seen a great deal of him,', 'have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on', 'subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,', 'I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed,', 'enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively,', 'his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate', 'and pure.  His abilities in every respect improve', 'as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.', 'At first sight, his address is certainly not striking;', 'and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the', 'expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good,', 'and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.', 'At present, I know him so well, that I think him', 'really handsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you,', 'Marianne?\"', '\"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I', 'do not now.  When you tell me to love him as a brother,', 'I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do', 'in his heart.\"', 'Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for', 'the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.', 'She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion.', 'She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required', \"greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction\", 'of their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that', 'what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment,', 'they believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope,', 'and to hope was to expect.  She tried to explain the real', 'state of the case to her sister.', '\"I do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that I think', 'very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"', 'Marianne here burst forth with indignation--', '\"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!', 'worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.', 'Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment.\"', 'Elinor could not help laughing.  \"Excuse me,\"', 'said she; \"and be assured that I meant no offence to you,', 'by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.', 'Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;', 'believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the', 'suspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant,', 'without imprudence or folly.  But farther than this you must', 'not believe.  I am by no means assured of his regard for me.', 'There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful;', 'and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder', 'at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality,', 'by believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart', 'I feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.', 'But there are other points to be considered besides', 'his inclination.  He is very far from being independent.', \"What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's\", 'occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have', 'never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very', 'much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there', 'would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish', 'to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or', 'high rank.\"', 'Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination', 'of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.', '\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she.', '\"Yet it certainly soon will happen.  But two advantages', 'will proceed from this delay.  I shall not lose you so soon,', 'and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving', 'that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must', 'be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.', 'Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to', 'learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!\"', 'Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.', 'She could not consider her partiality for Edward', 'in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it.', 'There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which,', 'if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost', 'as unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him', 'to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.', 'It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind', 'which frequently attended him.  A more reasonable cause', 'might be found in the dependent situation which forbade', 'the indulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother', 'neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable', 'at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form', 'a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views', 'for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge as this,', 'it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.', 'She was far from depending on that result of his preference', 'of her, which her mother and sister still considered', 'as certain.  Nay, the longer they were together the more', 'doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes,', 'for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more', 'than friendship.', 'But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough,', 'when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy,', 'and at the same time, (which was still more common,)', 'to make her uncivil.  She took the first opportunity of', 'affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to', \"her so expressively of her brother's great expectations,\", \"of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should\", 'marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman', 'who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could', 'neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.', 'She gave her an answer which marked her contempt,', 'and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might', 'be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal,', 'her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week', 'to such insinuations.', 'In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered', 'to her from the post, which contained a proposal', 'particularly well timed.  It was the offer of a small house,', 'on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own,', 'a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.', 'The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written', 'in the true spirit of friendly accommodation.', 'He understood that she was in need of a dwelling;', 'and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,', 'he assured her that everything should be done to it which', 'she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her.', 'He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars', 'of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to', 'Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence', 'she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the', 'houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration,', 'be made comfortable to her.  He seemed really anxious to', 'accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written', 'in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure', 'to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was', 'suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her', 'nearer connections.  She needed no time for deliberation', 'or inquiry.  Her resolution was formed as she read.', 'The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from', 'Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before,', 'would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every', 'possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its', 'first recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland', 'was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;', 'it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing', \"her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever\", 'from that beloved place would be less painful than to', 'inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.', 'She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment', 'of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;', 'and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters,', 'that she might be secure of their approbation before her', 'answer were sent.', 'Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent', 'for them to settle at some distance from Norland,', 'than immediately amongst their present acquaintance.', 'On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose', \"her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.\", 'The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so', 'simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate,', 'as to leave her no right of objection on either point;', 'and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought', 'any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from', 'the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made', 'no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter', 'of acquiescence.', 'CHAPTER 5', 'No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood', 'indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her', 'son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house,', 'and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were', 'ready for her inhabiting it.  They heard her with surprise.', 'Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly', 'hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.', 'She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going', 'into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her,', 'on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern,', 'which required no explanation to her, repeated,', '\"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there?  So far from hence!', 'And to what part of it?\"  She explained the situation.', 'It was within four miles northward of Exeter.', '\"It is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but I hope', 'to see many of my friends in it.  A room or two can', 'easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty', 'in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find', 'none in accommodating them.\"', 'She concluded with a very kind invitation to', 'Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton;', 'and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection.', 'Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had', 'made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than', 'was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect', 'on her in that point to which it principally tended.', 'To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her', 'object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood,', 'by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she', 'disregarded her disapprobation of the match.', 'Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again', 'how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at', 'such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any', 'service to her in removing her furniture.  He really felt', 'conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion', 'to which he had limited the performance of his promise to', 'his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.--', 'The furniture was all sent around by water.  It chiefly', 'consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,', \"with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.  Mrs. John\", 'Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could', \"not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income\", 'would be so trifling in comparison with their own,', 'she should have any handsome article of furniture.', 'Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was', 'ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession.', 'No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she', 'waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland,', 'and to determine her future household, before she set', 'off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid', 'in the performance of everything that interested her,', 'was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband', 'had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity', 'now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed', 'to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her', 'eldest daughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she', 'consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it;', 'but the discretion of Elinor prevailed.  HER wisdom', 'too limited the number of their servants to three;', 'two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided', 'from amongst those who had formed their establishment', 'at Norland.', 'The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately', \"into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's\", 'arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown', 'to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the', 'cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied', \"so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house,\", 'as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she', 'entered it as her own.  Her eagerness to be gone from Norland', 'was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction', 'of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal;', 'a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed', 'under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.', \"Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his\", 'father might with particular propriety be fulfilled.', 'Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to', 'the estate, their quitting his house might be looked', 'on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment.', 'But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every', 'hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general', 'drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no', 'farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.', 'He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses', 'of housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse,', 'which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond', 'calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand', 'in need of more money himself than to have any design of', 'giving money away.', 'In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir', \"John Middleton's first letter to Norland, every thing was\", 'so far settled in their future abode as to enable', 'Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.', 'Many were the tears shed by them in their last', 'adieus to a place so much beloved.  \"Dear, dear Norland!\"', 'said Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house,', 'on the last evening of their being there; \"when shall I cease', 'to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!', 'happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing', 'you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view', 'you no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you', 'will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we', 'are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we', 'can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same;', 'unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion,', 'and insensible of any change in those who walk under your', 'shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you?\"', 'CHAPTER 6', 'The first part of their journey was performed in too', 'melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious', 'and unpleasant.  But as they drew towards the end of it,', 'their interest in the appearance of a country which they', 'were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of', 'Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.', 'It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich', 'in pasture.  After winding along it for more than a mile,', 'they reached their own house.  A small green court was', 'the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate', 'admitted them into it.', 'As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable', 'and compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the', 'building was regular, the roof was tiled, the window', 'shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered', 'with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly through', 'the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the', 'entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square;', 'and beyond them were the offices and the stairs.', 'Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house.', 'It had not been built many years and was in good repair.', 'In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but', 'the tears which recollection called forth as they entered', 'the house were soon dried away.  They were cheered', 'by the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each', 'for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.', 'It was very early in September; the season was fine,', 'and from first seeing the place under the advantage', 'of good weather, they received an impression in its', 'favour which was of material service in recommending', 'it to their lasting approbation.', 'The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose', 'immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side;', 'some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.', 'The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills,', 'and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.', 'The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the', 'whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.', 'The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated', 'the valley in that direction; under another name,', 'and in another course, it branched out again between two', 'of the steepest of them.', 'With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood', 'was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former', 'style of life rendered many additions to the latter', 'indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her;', 'and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all', 'that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.', '\"As for the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is', 'too small for our family, but we will make ourselves', 'tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late', 'in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring,', 'if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may', 'think about building.  These parlors are both too small', 'for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often', 'collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the', 'passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other,', 'and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance;', 'this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added,', 'and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug', 'little cottage.  I could wish the stairs were handsome.', 'But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it', 'would be no difficult matter to widen them.  I shall see', 'how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring,', 'and we will plan our improvements accordingly.\"', 'In the mean time, till all these alterations could', 'be made from the savings of an income of five hundred', 'a-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were', 'wise enough to be contented with the house as it was;', 'and each of them was busy in arranging their particular', 'concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books', 'and other possessions, to form themselves a home.', \"Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of;\", \"and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls of their\", 'sitting room.', 'In such employments as these they were interrupted', 'soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of', 'their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton,', 'and to offer them every accommodation from his own house', 'and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.', 'Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.', 'He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long', 'for his young cousins to remember him.  His countenance', 'was thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were', 'as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrival', 'seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort', 'to be an object of real solicitude to him.  He said much', 'of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable', 'terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially', 'to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better', 'settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried', 'to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could', 'not give offence.  His kindness was not confined to words;', 'for within an hour after he left them, a large basket', 'full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park,', 'which was followed before the end of the day by a present', 'of game.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their', 'letters to and from the post for them, and would not be', 'denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper', 'every day.', 'Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him,', 'denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as', 'she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience;', 'and as this message was answered by an invitation', 'equally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.', 'They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on', 'whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the', 'elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes.', 'Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty;', 'her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,', 'and her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegance', \"which her husband's wanted.  But they would have been\", 'improved by some share of his frankness and warmth;', 'and her visit was long enough to detract something from', 'their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly', 'well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say', 'for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.', 'Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John', 'was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise', 'precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine', 'little boy about six years old, by which means there was', 'one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case', 'of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age,', 'admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother', 'answered for him, while he hung about her and held', 'down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship,', 'who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he', 'could make noise enough at home.  On every formal visit', 'a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision', 'for discourse.  In the present case it took up ten minutes', 'to determine whether the boy were most like his father', 'or mother, and in what particular he resembled either,', 'for of course every body differed, and every body was', 'astonished at the opinion of the others.', 'An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods', 'of debating on the rest of the children, as Sir John', 'would not leave the house without securing their promise', 'of dining at the park the next day.', 'CHAPTER 7', 'Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.', 'The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley,', 'but it was screened from their view at home by the', 'projection of a hill.  The house was large and handsome;', 'and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality', \"and elegance.  The former was for Sir John's gratification,\", 'the latter for that of his lady.  They were scarcely', 'ever without some friends staying with them in the house,', 'and they kept more company of every kind than any other', 'family in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary to the', 'happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper', 'and outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other', 'in that total want of talent and taste which confined', 'their employments, unconnected with such as society produced,', 'within a very narrow compass.  Sir John was a sportsman,', 'Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and she', 'humoured her children; and these were their only resources.', 'Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her', \"children all the year round, while Sir John's independent\", 'employments were in existence only half the time.', 'Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,', 'supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education;', 'supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise', 'to the good breeding of his wife.', 'Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance', 'of her table, and of all her domestic arrangements;', 'and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment', \"in any of their parties.  But Sir John's satisfaction\", 'in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting', 'about him more young people than his house would hold,', 'and the noisier they were the better was he pleased.', 'He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood,', 'for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold', 'ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private', 'balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not', 'suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.', 'The arrival of a new family in the country was always', 'a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was', 'charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his', 'cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty,', 'and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his good opinion;', 'for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could', 'want to make her mind as captivating as her person.', 'The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in', 'accommodating those, whose situation might be considered,', 'in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  In showing', 'kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction', 'of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only', 'in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman;', 'for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who', 'are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging', 'their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own', 'manor.', 'Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door', 'of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton', 'Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them', 'to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern', 'which the same subject had drawn from him the day before,', 'at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.', 'They would see, he said, only one gentleman there', 'besides himself; a particular friend who was staying at', 'the park, but who was neither very young nor very gay.', 'He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party,', 'and could assure them it should never happen so again.', 'He had been to several families that morning in hopes', 'of procuring some addition to their number, but it', 'was moonlight and every body was full of engagements.', \"Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton\", 'within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful', 'agreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find', 'it so very dull as they might imagine.  The young ladies,', 'as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with', 'having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for', 'no more.', \"Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a\", 'good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a', 'great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar.  She was full', 'of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said', 'many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands;', 'hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,', 'and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.', \"Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned\", 'her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks,', 'with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than', \"could arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings's.\", 'Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no', 'more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend,', 'than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings', \"to be Lady Middleton's mother.  He was silent and grave.\", 'His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite', 'of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret', 'an absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side', 'of five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome,', 'his countenance was sensible, and his address was', 'particularly gentlemanlike.', 'There was nothing in any of the party which could', 'recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold', 'insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive,', 'that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon,', 'and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his', 'mother-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed', 'to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her', 'four noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about,', 'tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse', 'except what related to themselves.', 'In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical,', 'she was invited to play.  The instrument was unlocked,', 'every body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne,', 'who sang very well, at their request went through the', 'chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into', 'the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain', 'ever since in the same position on the pianoforte,', 'for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving', \"up music, although by her mother's account, she had\", 'played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.', \"Marianne's performance was highly applauded.\", 'Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song,', 'and as loud in his conversation with the others while every', 'song lasted.  Lady Middleton frequently called him to order,', \"wondered how any one's attention could be diverted from music\", 'for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song', 'which Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone,', 'of all the party, heard her without being in raptures.', 'He paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt', 'a respect for him on the occasion, which the others had', 'reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste.', 'His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that', 'ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,', 'was estimable when contrasted against the horrible', 'insensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough', 'to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have', 'outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite', 'power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make', \"every allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life\", 'which humanity required.', 'CHAPTER 8', 'Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.', 'She had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived', 'to see respectably married, and she had now therefore', 'nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world.', 'In the promotion of this object she was zealously active,', 'as far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity', 'of projecting weddings among all the young people', 'of her acquaintance.  She was remarkably quick in the', 'discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage', 'of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young', 'lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man;', 'and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her', 'arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel', 'Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood.', 'She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first', 'evening of their being together, from his listening', 'so attentively while she sang to them; and when the visit', \"was returned by the Middletons' dining at the cottage,\", 'the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.', 'It must be so.  She was perfectly convinced of it.', 'It would be an excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE', 'was handsome.  Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see', 'Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection', 'with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;', 'and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every', 'pretty girl.', 'The immediate advantage to herself was by no means', 'inconsiderable, for it supplied her with endless jokes', 'against them both.  At the park she laughed at the colonel,', 'and in the cottage at Marianne.  To the former her', 'raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,', 'perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at', 'first incomprehensible; and when its object was understood,', 'she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity,', 'or censure its impertinence, for she considered it as an', \"unfeeling reflection on the colonel's advanced years,\", 'and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.', 'Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years', 'younger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared', 'to the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear', 'Mrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw', 'ridicule on his age.', '\"But at least, Mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity', 'of the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally', 'ill-natured.  Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than', 'Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY father;', 'and if he were ever animated enough to be in love,', 'must have long outlived every sensation of the kind.', 'It is too ridiculous!  When is a man to be safe from such wit,', 'if age and infirmity will not protect him?\"', '\"Infirmity!\" said Elinor, \"do you call Colonel Brandon', 'infirm?  I can easily suppose that his age may appear much', 'greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly', 'deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!\"', '\"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?', 'and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?\"', '\"My dearest child,\" said her mother, laughing,', '\"at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay;', 'and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been', 'extended to the advanced age of forty.\"', '\"Mamma, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well', 'that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends', 'yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature.', 'He may live twenty years longer.  But thirty-five has', 'nothing to do with matrimony.\"', '\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, \"thirty-five and seventeen had', 'better not have any thing to do with matrimony together.', 'But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman', 'who is single at seven and twenty, I should not think', \"Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to his\", 'marrying HER.\"', '\"A woman of seven and twenty,\" said Marianne,', 'after pausing a moment, \"can never hope to feel or inspire', 'affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable,', 'or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might', 'bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse,', 'for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.', 'In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be', 'nothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact of convenience,', 'and the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would', 'be no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.', 'To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which', 'each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other.\"', '\"It would be impossible, I know,\" replied Elinor,', '\"to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could', 'feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough', 'to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.', 'But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and', 'his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber,', 'merely because he chanced to complain yesterday (a', 'very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one', 'of his shoulders.\"', '\"But he talked of flannel waistcoats,\" said Marianne;', '\"and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected', 'with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of', 'ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble.\"', '\"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not', 'have despised him half so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not', 'there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek,', 'hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?\"', \"Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room,\", '\"Mamma,\" said Marianne, \"I have an alarm on the subject', 'of illness which I cannot conceal from you.  I am sure', 'Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have now been here almost', 'a fortnight, and yet he does not come.  Nothing but real', 'indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.', 'What else can detain him at Norland?\"', '\"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?\"', 'said Mrs. Dashwood.  \"I had none.  On the contrary,', 'if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has', 'been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want', 'of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation,', 'when I talked of his coming to Barton.  Does Elinor', 'expect him already?\"', '\"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course', 'she must.\"', '\"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I', 'was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate', 'for the spare bedchamber, she observed that there', 'was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely', 'that the room would be wanted for some time.\"', '\"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!', 'But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been', 'unaccountable! How cold, how composed were their last', 'adieus! How languid their conversation the last evening', \"of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was no\", 'distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes', 'of an affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave', 'them purposely together in the course of the last morning,', 'and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out', 'of the room.  And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward,', 'cried not as I did.  Even now her self-command is invariable.', 'When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try', 'to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied', 'in it?\"', 'CHAPTER 9', 'The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable', 'comfort to themselves.  The house and the garden, with all', 'the objects surrounding them, were now become familiar,', 'and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland', 'half its charms were engaged in again with far greater', 'enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the', 'loss of their father.  Sir John Middleton, who called', 'on them every day for the first fortnight, and who was', 'not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home,', 'could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.', 'Their visitors, except those from Barton Park,', \"were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties\", 'that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated', 'assurances of his carriage being always at their service,', \"the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the\", 'wish of society for her children; and she was resolute', 'in declining to visit any family beyond the distance', 'of a walk.  There were but few who could be so classed;', 'and it was not all of them that were attainable.', 'About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow', 'winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton,', 'as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their', 'earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking', 'mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland,', 'interested their imagination and made them wish to be', 'better acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry,', 'that its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character,', 'was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world,', 'and never stirred from home.', 'The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.', 'The high downs which invited them from almost every window', 'of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air', 'on their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt', 'of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties;', 'and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret', 'one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the', 'partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear', 'the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding', 'days had occasioned.  The weather was not tempting enough', 'to draw the two others from their pencil and their book,', \"in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would\", 'be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would', 'be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off', 'together.', 'They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own', 'penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they', 'caught in their faces the animating gales of a high', 'south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented', 'their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.', '\"Is there a felicity in the world,\" said Marianne,', '\"superior to this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least', 'two hours.\"', 'Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against', 'the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about', 'twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over', 'their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.--', 'Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly,', 'to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house.', 'One consolation however remained for them, to which the', 'exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety;', 'it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep', 'side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.', 'They set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage,', 'but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground;', 'and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her,', 'was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom', 'in safety.', 'A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers', 'playing round him, was passing up the hill and within', 'a few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened.', 'He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  She had', 'raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been', 'twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.', 'The gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her', 'modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary,', 'took her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried', 'her down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,', 'the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her', 'directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived,', 'and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair', 'in the parlour.', 'Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at', 'their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed', 'on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration', 'which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized', 'for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner', 'so frank and so graceful that his person, which was', 'uncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice', 'and expression.  Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar,', 'the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would', 'have been secured by any act of attention to her child;', 'but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance,', 'gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings.', 'She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness', 'of address which always attended her, invited him to', 'be seated.  But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet.', 'Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged.', 'His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present', 'home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would', 'allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire', 'after Miss Dashwood.  The honour was readily granted,', 'and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,', 'in the midst of a heavy rain.', 'His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness', 'were instantly the theme of general admiration,', 'and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne', 'received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.--', 'Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest,', 'for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his', 'lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding', 'him after their entering the house.  But she had seen', 'enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others,', 'and with an energy which always adorned her praise.', 'His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever', 'drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying', 'her into the house with so little previous formality, there', 'was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended', 'the action to her.  Every circumstance belonging to him', 'was interesting.  His name was good, his residence was in', 'their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all', 'manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.', 'Her imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant,', 'and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.', 'Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval', 'of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out', \"of doors; and Marianne's accident being related to him,\", 'he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman', 'of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.', '\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is HE', 'in the country? That is good news however; I will', 'ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday.\"', '\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.', '\"Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here', 'every year.\"', '\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"', '\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.', 'A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider', 'in England.\"', '\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne,', 'indignantly.  \"But what are his manners on more intimate', 'acquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?\"', 'Sir John was rather puzzled.', '\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him', 'as to all THAT.  But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow,', 'and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer', 'I ever saw.  Was she out with him today?\"', 'But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the', \"colour of Mr. Willoughby's pointer, than he could\", 'describe to her the shades of his mind.', '\"But who is he?\" said Elinor.  \"Where does he come', 'from?  Has he a house at Allenham?\"', 'On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence;', 'and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property', 'of his own in the country; that he resided there only', 'while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court,', 'to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was', 'to inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth', 'catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty', 'little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides;', 'and if I were you, I would not give him up to my', 'younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.', 'Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.', 'Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care.\"', '\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a', 'good humoured smile, \"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded', 'by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what', 'you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment to which', 'they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us,', 'let them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however,', 'from what you say, that he is a respectable young man,', 'and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible.\"', '\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe,', 'as ever lived,\" repeated Sir John.  \"I remember', 'last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced', 'from eight o\\'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"', '\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes,', '\"and with elegance, with spirit?\"', '\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"', '\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought', 'to be.  Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them', 'should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue.\"', '\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see', 'how it will be.  You will be setting your cap at him now,', 'and never think of poor Brandon.\"', '\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne,', 'warmly, \"which I particularly dislike.  I abhor every', \"common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and 'setting\", \"one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,' are the most\", 'odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal;', 'and if their construction could ever be deemed clever,', 'time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity.\"', 'Sir John did not much understand this reproof;', 'but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,', '\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say,', 'one way or other.  Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already,', 'and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can', 'tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining', 'of ankles.\"', 'CHAPTER 10', \"Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance\", 'than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage', 'early the next morning to make his personal enquiries.', 'He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness;', \"with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her own\", 'gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during', 'the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance,', 'mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family', 'to whom accident had now introduced him.  Of their', 'personal charms he had not required a second interview', 'to be convinced.', 'Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion,', 'regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.', 'Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form, though not so', \"correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of height,\", 'was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when', 'in the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl,', 'truth was less violently outraged than usually happens.', 'Her skin was very brown, but, from its transparency,', 'her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features', 'were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive;', 'and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life,', 'a spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen', 'without delight.  From Willoughby their expression was at', 'first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance', 'of his assistance created.  But when this passed away,', 'when her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the', 'perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness', 'and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,', 'that of music and dancing he was passionately fond,', 'she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the', 'largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest', 'of his stay.', 'It was only necessary to mention any favourite', 'amusement to engage her to talk.  She could not be', 'silent when such points were introduced, and she', 'had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.', 'They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing', 'and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general', 'conformity of judgment in all that related to either.', 'Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,', 'she proceeded to question him on the subject of books;', 'her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt', 'upon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of', 'five and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to', 'become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works,', 'however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly alike.', 'The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--', 'or if any difference appeared, any objection arose,', 'it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments', 'and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.', 'He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm;', 'and long before his visit concluded, they conversed', 'with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.', '\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them,', '\"for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well.', \"You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in\", 'almost every matter of importance.  You know what he thinks', 'of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating', 'their beauties as he ought, and you have received every', 'assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.', 'But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such', 'extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?', 'You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.', 'Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments', 'on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then', 'you can have nothing farther to ask.\"--', '\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this', 'just? are my ideas so scanty?  But I see what you mean.', 'I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank.', 'I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum;', 'I have been open and sincere where I ought to have', 'been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had', 'I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I', 'spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have', 'been spared.\"', '\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended', 'with Elinor--she was only in jest.  I should scold', 'her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check', 'the delight of your conversation with our new friend.\"--', 'Marianne was softened in a moment.', 'Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his', 'pleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish', 'of improving it could offer.  He came to them every day.', 'To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the', 'encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave', 'greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it', \"had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.\", 'She was confined for some days to the house; but never had', 'any confinement been less irksome.  Willoughby was a young', 'man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits,', 'and open, affectionate manners.  He was exactly formed', \"to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined\", 'not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour', 'of mind which was now roused and increased by the example', 'of her own, and which recommended him to her affection', 'beyond every thing else.', 'His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.', 'They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical', 'talents were considerable; and he read with all the', 'sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.', \"In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless\", \"as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him\", 'but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly', 'delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on', 'every occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.', 'In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people,', 'in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment', 'of undivided attention where his heart was engaged,', 'and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety,', 'he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve,', 'in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.', 'Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation', 'which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever', 'seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection,', 'had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was all', 'that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour', 'and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her;', 'and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect', 'as earnest, as his abilities were strong.', 'Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative', 'thought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect', 'of riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and', 'expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having', 'gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.', \"Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had\", 'so early been discovered by his friends, now first became', 'perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed', 'by them.  Their attention and wit were drawn off to his', 'more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other', 'had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed', 'when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule', 'so justly annexed to sensibility.  Elinor was obliged,', 'though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which', 'Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction,', 'were now actually excited by her sister; and that however', 'a general resemblance of disposition between the parties', 'might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally', 'striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the', 'regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;', 'for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope,', 'when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as', 'she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished', 'him indifferent.  She liked him--in spite of his gravity', 'and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.', 'His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve', 'appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits', 'than of any natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John', 'had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments,', 'which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man,', 'and she regarded him with respect and compassion.', 'Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more', 'because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne,', 'who, prejudiced against him for being neither lively', 'nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.', '\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby', 'one day, when they were talking of him together,', '\"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about;', 'whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers', 'to talk to.\"', '\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.', '\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it', 'is injustice in both of you.  He is highly esteemed', 'by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself', 'without taking pains to converse with him.\"', '\"That he is patronised by YOU,\" replied Willoughby,', '\"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem', 'of the others, it is a reproach in itself.  Who would', 'submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman', 'as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command', 'the indifference of any body else?\"', '\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself', 'and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady', 'Middleton and her mother.  If their praise is censure,', 'your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning,', 'than you are prejudiced and unjust.\"', '\"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.\"', '\"My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man;', 'and sense will always have attractions for me.', 'Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.', 'He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,', 'has read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him', 'capable of giving me much information on various subjects;', 'and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of', 'good-breeding and good nature.\"', '\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously,', '\"he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot,', 'and the mosquitoes are troublesome.\"', '\"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made', 'any such inquiries, but they happened to be points', 'on which I had been previously informed.\"', '\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may', 'have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs,', 'and palanquins.\"', '\"I may venture to say that HIS observations', 'have stretched much further than your candour.', 'But why should you dislike him?\"', '\"I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary,', \"as a very respectable man, who has every body's good word,\", \"and nobody's notice; who, has more money than he can spend,\", 'more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats', 'every year.\"', '\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has', 'neither genius, taste, nor spirit.  That his understanding', 'has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice', 'no expression.\"', '\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\"', 'replied Elinor, \"and so much on the strength of your', 'own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give', 'of him is comparatively cold and insipid.  I can only', 'pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed,', 'of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart.\"', '\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using', 'me unkindly.  You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason,', 'and to convince me against my will.  But it will not do.', 'You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful.  I have', 'three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon;', 'he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine;', 'he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle,', 'and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.  If it', 'will be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told,', 'that I believe his character to be in other respects', 'irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return', 'for an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain,', 'you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much', 'as ever.\"', 'CHAPTER 11', 'Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined', 'when they first came into Devonshire, that so many', 'engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly', 'presented themselves, or that they should have such frequent', 'invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little', 'leisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.', 'When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home', 'and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming,', 'were put into execution.  The private balls at the park', 'then began; and parties on the water were made and', 'accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.', 'In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included;', 'and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended', 'these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing', 'intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford', 'him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne,', 'of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,', 'in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance', 'of her affection.', 'Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.', 'She only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once', 'or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some', 'self-command to Marianne.  But Marianne abhorred all', 'concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;', 'and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not', 'in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely', 'an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection', 'of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.', 'Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at', 'all times, was an illustration of their opinions.', 'When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.', 'Every thing he did, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.', 'If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards,', 'he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get', 'her a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusement', 'of the night, they were partners for half the time;', 'and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances,', 'were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word', 'to any body else.  Such conduct made them of course', 'most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame,', 'and seemed hardly to provoke them.', 'Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with', 'a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this', 'excessive display of them.  To her it was but the natural', 'consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.', 'This was the season of happiness to Marianne.', 'Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment', 'to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex,', 'was more likely to be softened than she had thought it', 'possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed', 'on her present home.', \"Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not\", 'so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements', 'so pure.  They afforded her no companion that could make', 'amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach', 'her to think of Norland with less regret than ever.', 'Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply', 'to her the conversation she missed; although the latter', 'was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded', 'her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of', 'her discourse.  She had already repeated her own history', \"to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been\", 'equal to her means of improvement, she might have known', 'very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of', \"Mr. Jenning's last illness, and what he said to his wife\", 'a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton was more', 'agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.', 'Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her', 'reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense', 'had nothing to do.  Towards her husband and mother she', 'was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore', 'neither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing', 'to say one day that she had not said the day before.', 'Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were', 'always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties', 'arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted', 'in style and her two eldest children attended her,', 'she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them', 'than she might have experienced in sitting at home;--', 'and so little did her presence add to the pleasure', 'of the others, by any share in their conversation,', 'that they were sometimes only reminded of her being', 'amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.', 'In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance,', 'did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the', 'respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship,', 'or give pleasure as a companion.  Willoughby was out', 'of the question.  Her admiration and regard, even her', 'sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover;', \"his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less\", 'agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.', 'Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such', 'encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing', 'with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the', 'indifference of her sister.', \"Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason\", 'to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already', 'been known to him.  This suspicion was given by some words', 'which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park,', 'when they were sitting down together by mutual consent,', 'while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed', 'on Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes,', 'he said, with a faint smile, \"Your sister, I understand,', 'does not approve of second attachments.\"', '\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"', '\"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them', 'impossible to exist.\"', '\"I believe she does.  But how she contrives it', 'without reflecting on the character of her own father,', 'who had himself two wives, I know not.  A few years', 'however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis', 'of common sense and observation; and then they may be', 'more easy to define and to justify than they now are,', 'by any body but herself.\"', '\"This will probably be the case,\" he replied;', '\"and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices', 'of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way', 'to the reception of more general opinions.\"', '\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor.', '\"There are inconveniences attending such feelings', \"as Marianne's, which all the charms of enthusiasm and\", 'ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her systems have', 'all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought;', 'and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look', 'forward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"', 'After a short pause he resumed the conversation', 'by saying,--', '\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections', 'against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal', 'in every body?  Are those who have been disappointed', 'in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy', 'of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances,', 'to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"', '\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae', 'of her principles.  I only know that I never yet heard her', 'admit any instance of a second attachment\\'s being pardonable.\"', '\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change,', 'a total change of sentiments--No, no, do not desire it;', 'for when the romantic refinements of a young mind', 'are obliged to give way, how frequently are they', 'succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too', 'dangerous!  I speak from experience.  I once knew a lady', 'who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister,', 'who thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced', 'change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"--', 'Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said', 'too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,', \"which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head.\", 'The lady would probably have passed without suspicion,', 'had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned', 'her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was,', 'it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his', 'emotion with the tender recollection of past regard.', 'Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne, in her place,', 'would not have done so little.  The whole story would', 'have been speedily formed under her active imagination;', 'and every thing established in the most melancholy order', 'of disastrous love.', 'CHAPTER 12', 'As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the', 'next morning the latter communicated a piece of news', 'to her sister, which in spite of all that she knew', \"before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,\", 'surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.', 'Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that', 'Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred', 'himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was', 'exactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering', \"that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse,\", 'that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of', 'this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and', 'keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable', 'to receive them, she had accepted the present without', 'hesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.', '\"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire', 'immediately for it,\" she added, \"and when it arrives we', 'will ride every day.  You shall share its use with me.', 'Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop', 'on some of these downs.\"', 'Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of', 'felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended', 'the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them.', 'As to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle;', 'Mamma she was sure would never object to it; and any horse', 'would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park;', 'as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.', 'Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving', 'such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately', 'known to her.  This was too much.', '\"You are mistaken, Elinor,\" said she warmly,', '\"in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.', 'I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better', 'acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature', 'in the world, except yourself and mama.  It is not', 'time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--', 'it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be insufficient', 'to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven', 'days are more than enough for others.  I should hold', 'myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse', 'from my brother, than from Willoughby.  Of John I know', 'very little, though we have lived together for years;', 'but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.\"', 'Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.', \"She knew her sister's temper.  Opposition on so tender a\", 'subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion.', 'But by an appeal to her affection for her mother,', 'by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent', 'mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be', 'the case) she consented to this increase of establishment,', 'Marianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to', 'tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning', 'the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next,', 'that it must be declined.', 'She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby', 'called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her', 'express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on', 'being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present.', 'The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,', 'and they were such as to make further entreaty on his', 'side impossible.  His concern however was very apparent;', 'and after expressing it with earnestness, he added,', 'in the same low voice,--\"But, Marianne, the horse is', 'still yours, though you cannot use it now.  I shall keep', 'it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton', 'to form your own establishment in a more lasting home,', 'Queen Mab shall receive you.\"', 'This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the', 'whole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it,', 'and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone,', 'she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning', 'so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them.', 'From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged', 'to each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise', 'than that she, or any of their friends, should be left', 'by tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.', 'Margaret related something to her the next day,', 'which placed this matter in a still clearer light.', 'Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them,', 'and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour', 'with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity', 'for observations, which, with a most important face,', 'she communicated to her eldest sister, when they were', 'next by themselves.', '\"Oh, Elinor!\" she cried, \"I have such a secret to', 'tell you about Marianne.  I am sure she will be married', 'to Mr. Willoughby very soon.\"', '\"You have said so,\" replied Elinor, \"almost every', 'day since they first met on High-church Down; and they', 'had not known each other a week, I believe, before you', 'were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck;', 'but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle.\"', '\"But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure', 'they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock', 'of her hair.\"', '\"Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair', 'of some great uncle of HIS.\"', '\"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne\\'s. I am almost', 'sure it is, for I saw him cut it off.  Last night', 'after tea, when you and mama went out of the room,', 'they were whispering and talking together as fast as', 'could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her,', 'and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long', 'lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back;', 'and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper;', 'and put it into his pocket-book.\"', 'For such particulars, stated on such authority,', 'Elinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed', 'to it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with', 'what she had heard and seen herself.', \"Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a\", 'way so satisfactory to her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings', 'attacked her one evening at the park, to give the name', \"of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite,\", 'which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,', 'Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying,', '\"I must not tell, may I, Elinor?\"', 'This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor', 'tried to laugh too.  But the effort was painful.', 'She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person', 'whose name she could not bear with composure to become', 'a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.', 'Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did', 'more harm than good to the cause, by turning very red', 'and saying in an angry manner to Margaret,', '\"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be,', 'you have no right to repeat them.\"', '\"I never had any conjectures about it,\" replied Margaret;', '\"it was you who told me of it yourself.\"', 'This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret', 'was eagerly pressed to say something more.', '\"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,\"', 'said Mrs. Jennings.  \"What is the gentleman\\'s name?\"', '\"I must not tell, ma\\'am. But I know very well what it is;', 'and I know where he is too.\"', '\"Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house', 'at Norland to be sure.

He is of no profession at all.\"', '\"Margaret,\" said Marianne with great warmth,', '\"you know that all this is an invention of your own,', 'and that there is no such person in existence.\"', '\"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I', 'am sure there was such a man once, and his name begins', 'with an F.\"', 'Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton', 'for observing, at this moment, \"that it rained very hard,\"', 'though she believed the interruption to proceed less from', \"any attention to her, than from her ladyship's great dislike\", 'of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted', 'her husband and mother.  The idea however started by her,', 'was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was', 'on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others;', 'and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them.', 'Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne', 'to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours', 'of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.', 'But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into', 'which it had thrown her.', 'A party was formed this evening for going on the', 'following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles', 'from Barton, belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon,', 'without whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor,', 'who was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head.', 'The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,', 'and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise,', 'might be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had', 'formed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer', 'for the last ten years.  They contained a noble piece', 'of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of', \"the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken,\", 'open carriages only to be employed, and every thing', 'conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.', 'To some few of the company it appeared rather', 'a bold undertaking, considering the time of year,', 'and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;--', 'and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded', 'by Elinor to stay at home.', 'CHAPTER 13', 'Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out', 'very different from what Elinor had expected.

She wondered,', 'with little intermission what could be the reason of it;', 'was sure there must be some bad news, and thought over', 'every kind of distress that could have befallen him,', 'with a fixed determination that he should not escape', 'them all.', '\"Something very melancholy must be the matter,', 'I am sure,\" said she.  \"I could see it in his face.', 'Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances may be bad.', 'The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand', 'a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.', 'I do think he must have been sent for about money matters,', 'for what else can it be?  I wonder whether it is so.', 'I would give anything to know the truth of it.  Perhaps it', 'is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is,', 'because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.', 'May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely,', 'for I have a notion she is always rather sickly.', 'I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams.', 'It is not so very likely he should be distressed in', 'his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man,', 'and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time.', 'I wonder what it can be!  May be his sister is worse', 'at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting off', 'in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out', 'of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into', 'the bargain.\"', 'So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion', 'varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming', 'equally probable as they arose.  Elinor, though she felt', 'really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon,', 'could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly', 'away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling;', 'for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion', 'justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation,', 'her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was engrossed', 'by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby', 'on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly', 'interesting to them all.  As this silence continued,', 'every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible', 'with the disposition of both.  Why they should not openly', 'acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant', 'behaviour to each other declared to have taken place,', 'Elinor could not imagine.', 'She could easily conceive that marriage might not', 'be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby', 'was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.', 'His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven', 'hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income', 'could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained', 'of his poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy', 'maintained by them relative to their engagement, which', 'in fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account;', 'and it was so wholly contradictory to their general', 'opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered', 'her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt', 'was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.', 'Nothing could be more expressive of attachment', \"to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour.  To Marianne\", \"it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's\", 'heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the', 'affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The cottage', 'seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home;', 'many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham;', 'and if no general engagement collected them at the park,', 'the exercise which called him out in the morning was', 'almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day', 'was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his', 'favourite pointer at her feet.', 'One evening in particular, about a week after', 'Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed', 'more than usually open to every feeling of attachment', \"to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's\", 'happening to mention her design of improving the cottage', 'in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration', 'of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.', '\"What!\" he exclaimed--\"Improve this dear cottage!', 'No. THAT I will never consent to.  Not a stone must', 'be added to its walls, not an inch to its size,', 'if my feelings are regarded.\"', '\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood,', '\"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother', 'will never have money enough to attempt it.\"', '\"I am heartily glad of it,\" he cried.  \"May she', 'always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better.\"', '\"Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I', 'would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment', 'of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements', 'in the world.  Depend upon it that whatever unemployed', 'sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring,', 'I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose', 'of it in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really', 'so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?\"', '\"I am,\" said he.  \"To me it is faultless.  Nay, more,', 'I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness', 'is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull', 'Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this', 'cottage.\"', '\"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes,', 'I suppose,\" said Elinor.', '\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all', 'and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience', 'or INconvenience about it, should the least variation', 'be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under such a roof, I', 'might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton.\"', '\"I flatter myself,\" replied Elinor, \"that even under', 'the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase,', 'you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you', 'now do this.\"', '\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby,', '\"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will', 'always have one claim of my affection, which no other can', 'possibly share.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne,', 'whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby,', 'as plainly denoted how well she understood him.', '\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at', 'Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were', 'inhabited!  I never passed within view of it without admiring', 'its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it.', 'How little did I then think that the very first news', 'I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into', 'the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I', 'felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event,', 'which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I', 'should experience from it, can account for.  Must it not have', 'been so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered voice.', 'Then continuing his former tone, he said, \"And yet this', 'house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it', 'of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear', 'parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which', 'so many happy hours have been since spent by us together,', 'you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,', 'and every body would be eager to pass through the room', 'which has hitherto contained within itself more real', 'accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of', 'the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration', 'of the kind should be attempted.', '\"You are a good woman,\" he warmly replied.', '\"Your promise makes me easy.  Extend it a little farther,', 'and it will make me happy.  Tell me that not only your', 'house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find', 'you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you', 'will always consider me with the kindness which has made', 'everything belonging to you so dear to me.\"', \"The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's\", 'behaviour during the whole of the evening declared', 'at once his affection and happiness.', '\"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?\" said Mrs. Dashwood,', 'when he was leaving them.  \"I do not ask you to come in', 'the morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady', 'Middleton.\"', \"He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.\", 'CHAPTER 15', \"Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place\", 'the next day, and two of her daughters went with her;', 'but Marianne excused herself from being of the party,', 'under some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother,', 'who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby', 'the night before of calling on her while they were absent,', 'was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home.', \"On their return from the park they found Willoughby's\", 'curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage,', 'and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture', 'had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;', 'but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight', 'had taught her to expect.  They were no sooner in the', 'passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour', 'apparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief', 'at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.', 'Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room', 'she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby,', 'who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back', 'towards them.  He turned round on their coming in,', 'and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook', 'of the emotion which over-powered Marianne.', '\"Is anything the matter with her?\" cried Mrs. Dashwood', 'as she entered--\"is she ill?\"', '\"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful;', 'and with a forced smile presently added, \"It is I who may', 'rather expect to be ill--for I am now suffering under a', 'very heavy disappointment!\"', '\"Disappointment?\"', '\"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.', 'Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege', 'of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on', 'business to London.  I have just received my dispatches,', 'and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration', 'I am now come to take my farewell of you.\"', '\"To London!--and are you going this morning?\"', '\"Almost this moment.\"', '\"This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must', 'be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from', 'us long I hope.\"', 'He coloured as he replied, \"You are very kind, but I', 'have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately.', 'My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within', 'the twelvemonth.\"', '\"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only', 'house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?', 'For shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?\"', 'His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed', 'on the ground he only replied, \"You are too good.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.', 'Elinor felt equal amazement.  For a few moments every one', 'was silent.  Mrs. Dashwood first spoke.', '\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at', 'Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not', 'press you to return here immediately, because you only', 'can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith;', 'and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question', 'your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"', '\"My engagements at present,\" replied Willoughby,', 'confusedly, \"are of such a nature--that--I dare not flatter', 'myself\"--', 'He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished', 'to speak, and another pause succeeded.  This was broken', 'by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, \"It is folly', 'to linger in this manner.  I will not torment myself', 'any longer by remaining among friends whose society', 'it is impossible for me now to enjoy.\"', 'He then hastily took leave of them all and left', 'the room.  They saw him step into his carriage,', 'and in a minute it was out of sight.', 'Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly', 'quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern', 'and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.', \"Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.\", 'She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.', \"Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them, his\", 'embarrassment,', 'and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his', 'unwillingness', \"to accept her mother's invitation, a backwardness so unlike a\", 'lover,', 'so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared', 'that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the', 'next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him', 'and', 'her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room', 'was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for,', \"though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was,\", 'a quarrel seemed almost impossible.', 'But whatever might be the particulars of their separation,', \"her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought\", 'with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow', 'which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving', 'way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.', 'In about half an hour her mother returned, and though', 'her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.', '\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\"', 'said she, as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart', 'does he travel?\"', '\"It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It', 'seems but the work of a moment.  And last night he was', 'with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?  And now,', 'after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without intending', 'to return!--Something more than what be owned to us must', 'have happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave', 'like himself.  YOU must have seen the difference as well as I.', 'What can it be?  Can they have quarrelled?  Why else should he', 'have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?\"--', '\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could', 'plainly see THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.', 'I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can', 'perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed', 'strange to me as well as to you.\"', '\"Can you, indeed!\"', '\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most', 'satisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, who love to doubt', 'where you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you', 'shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am persuaded', 'that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,', 'disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views', 'for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--', 'and that the business which she sends him off to transact', 'is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.  This is what I', 'believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that she', 'DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore', 'at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne,', 'and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation,', 'to give into her schemes, and absent himself from', 'Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,', 'that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen', 'to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method', 'of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this.', 'And now, Elinor, what have you to say?\"', '\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"', '\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not', 'have happened.  Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your', 'feelings!  You had rather take evil upon credit than good.', 'You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt', 'for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter.', 'You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took', 'leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour', 'has shewn.  And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,', 'or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?  Are', 'no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they', 'are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we', 'have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world', 'to think ill of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable', 'in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?  And,', 'after all, what is it you suspect him of?\"', '\"I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of', 'something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence', 'of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him.', 'There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged', 'of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it', 'is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body.', 'Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient', 'reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.', 'But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge', 'them at once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I', 'cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him.\"', '\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from', 'his character, where the deviation is necessary.', 'But you really do admit the justice of what I have said', 'in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"', '\"Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their', 'engagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--', 'and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient', 'for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present.', 'But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"', '\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse', 'Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange', 'indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day', 'for incautiousness.\"', '\"I want no proof of their affection,\" said Elinor;', '\"but of their engagement I do.\"', '\"I am perfectly satisfied of both.\"', '\"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the', 'subject, by either of them.\"', '\"I have not wanted syllables where actions have', 'spoken so plainly.  Has not his behaviour to Marianne', 'and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight,', 'declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife,', 'and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest', 'relation?  Have we not perfectly understood each other?', 'Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner,', 'his attentive and affectionate respect?  My Elinor,', 'is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How could', 'such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed', 'that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your', \"sister's love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps\", 'for months, without telling her of his affection;--that', 'they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?\"', '\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance', 'except ONE is in favour of their engagement;', 'but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject,', 'and with me it almost outweighs every other.\"', '\"How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed', 'of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them,', 'you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together.', 'Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister', 'all this time?  Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?\"', '\"No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her', 'I am sure.\"', '\"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can', 'leave her with such indifference, such carelessness', 'of the future, as you attribute to him.\"', '\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never', 'considered this matter as certain.  I have had my doubts,', 'I confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they', 'may soon be entirely done away.  If we find they correspond,', 'every fear of mine will be removed.\"', '\"A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see', 'them at the altar, you would suppose they were going to', 'be married.  Ungracious girl!  But I require no such proof.', 'Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt;', 'no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open', \"and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.\", 'It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?', 'Is he not a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any', 'inconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?\"', '\"I hope not, I believe not,\" cried Elinor.', '\"I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his', 'integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me.', 'It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it.', 'I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his', 'manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself,', 'and did not return your kindness with any cordiality.', 'But all this may be explained by such a situation of his', 'affairs as you have supposed.  He had just parted from', 'my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction;', 'and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith,', 'to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet', 'aware that by declining your invitation, by saying', 'that he was going away for some time, he should seem', 'to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family,', 'be might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a case,', 'a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been', 'more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent', 'with his general character;--but I will not raise objections', \"against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation,\", 'as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from', 'what I may think right and consistent.\"', '\"You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does', 'not deserve to be suspected.  Though WE have not known', 'him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world;', 'and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?  Had he been', 'in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,', 'it might have been odd that he should leave us without', 'acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.', 'It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun,', 'for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance;', 'and even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now', 'be very advisable.\"', 'They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret;', 'and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations', 'of her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many,', 'and hope for the justice of all.', 'They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time,', 'when she entered the room and took her place at the table', 'without saying a word.  Her eyes were red and swollen;', 'and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained', 'with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all,', 'could neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her', \"mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion,\", 'her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst', 'into tears and left the room.', 'This violent oppression of spirits continued the', 'whole evening.  She was without any power, because she', 'was without any desire of command over herself.', 'The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby', 'overpowered her in an instant; and though her family', 'were most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was', 'impossible for them, if they spoke at all, to keep clear', 'of every subject which her feelings connected with him.', 'CHAPTER 16', 'Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable', 'had she been able to sleep at all the first night', 'after parting from Willoughby.  She would have been', 'ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning,', 'had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose', 'than when she lay down in it.  But the feelings which', 'made such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger', 'of incurring it.  She was awake the whole night, and she', 'wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with a headache,', 'was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;', 'giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters,', 'and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either.', 'Her sensibility was potent enough!', 'When breakfast was over she walked out by herself,', 'and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the', 'recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present', 'reverse for the chief of the morning.', 'The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.', 'She played over every favourite song that she had been used', 'to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices', 'had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing', 'on every line of music that he had written out for her,', 'till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness', 'could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every', 'day applied.  She spent whole hours at the pianoforte', 'alternately singing and crying; her voice often totally', 'suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as in music,', 'she courted the misery which a contrast between the past', 'and present was certain of giving.  She read nothing', 'but what they had been used to read together.', 'Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported', 'for ever; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy;', 'but these employments, to which she daily recurred,', 'her solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced', 'occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.', 'No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected', 'by Marianne.  Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again', 'became uneasy.  But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations', 'whenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself.', '\"Remember, Elinor,\" said she, \"how very often Sir John', 'fetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them', 'to it.  We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary,', 'and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if', 'their correspondence were to pass through Sir John\\'s hands.\"', 'Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried', 'to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence.', 'But there was one method so direct, so simple, and in', 'her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state', 'of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery,', 'that she could not help suggesting it to her mother.', '\"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\" said she,', '\"whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you,', 'her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question', 'could not give offence.  It would be the natural result', 'of your affection for her.  She used to be all unreserve,', 'and to you more especially.\"', '\"I would not ask such a question for the world.', 'Supposing it possible that they are not engaged,', 'what distress would not such an enquiry inflict!  At any', 'rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never deserve', 'her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession', 'of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.', \"I know Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me,\", 'and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made', 'known,', 'when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.', 'I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one;', 'of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent', 'the denial which her wishes might direct.\"', 'Elinor thought this generosity overstrained,', \"considering her sister's youth, and urged the matter farther,\", 'but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence,', \"were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.\", \"It was several days before Willoughby's name\", 'was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family;', 'Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice;', 'their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--', 'but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a', 'volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,', '\"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear', 'Willoughby went away before we could get through it.', 'We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may', 'be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.\"', '\"Months!\" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.', '\"No--nor many weeks.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said;', 'but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply', 'from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby', 'and knowledge of his intentions.', 'One morning, about a week after his leaving the country,', 'Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their', 'usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself.', 'Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in', 'her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,', 'she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked', 'of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills,', 'and could never be found when the others set off.', 'But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor,', 'who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.  They walked', 'along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,', \"for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor,\", 'satisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.', 'Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the country,', 'though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long', 'stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming', 'to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,', 'they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect', 'which formed the distance of their view from the cottage,', 'from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any', 'of their walks before.', 'Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered', 'an animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them.', 'In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman;', 'and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,', '\"It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!\"--and was', 'hastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out,', '\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is', 'not Willoughby.  The person is not tall enough for him,', 'and has not his air.\"', '\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has.', 'His air, his coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come.\"', 'She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor,', 'to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost', 'certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her', 'pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within', 'thirty yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again;', 'her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round,', 'she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters', 'were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known', \"as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop,\", 'and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome', 'Edward Ferrars.', 'He was the only person in the world who could', 'at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby;', 'the only one who could have gained a smile from her;', 'but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her', \"sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\", 'He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant,', 'walked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely', 'coming to visit them.', 'He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality,', 'but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of', 'regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself.', 'To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister', 'was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she', 'had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.', \"On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency\", 'of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.', 'He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure', 'in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,', 'said little but what was forced from him by questions,', 'and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.', 'Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise.', 'She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended,', 'as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her', 'thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast', 'sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.', 'After a short silence which succeeded the first', 'surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked', 'Edward if he came directly from London.  No, he had', 'been in Devonshire a fortnight.', '\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being', 'so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing', 'her before.', 'He looked rather distressed as he added, that he', 'had been staying with some friends near Plymouth.', '\"Have you been lately in Sussex?\" said Elinor.', '\"I was at Norland about a month ago.\"', '\"And how does dear, dear Norland look?\" cried Marianne.', '\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks', 'much as it always does at this time of the year.', 'The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves.\"', '\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation', 'have I formerly seen them fall!  How have I delighted,', 'as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me', 'by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season, the air', 'altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.', 'They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off,', 'and driven as much as possible from the sight.\"', '\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your', 'passion for dead leaves.\"', '\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often', 'understood.

You may see the end', 'of the house.  And there, beneath that farthest hill,', 'which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"', '\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these', 'bottoms must be dirty in winter.\"', '\"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"', '\"Because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the', 'objects before me, I see a very dirty lane.\"', '\"How strange!\" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.', '\"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the', 'Middletons pleasant people?\"', '\"No, not all,\" answered Marianne; \"we could not', 'be more unfortunately situated.\"', '\"Marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? How can', 'you be so unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr.', 'Ferrars;', 'and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner.

His coldness and reserve', 'mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry;', 'but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past', 'rather than the present, she avoided every appearance', 'of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she', 'thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.', 'CHAPTER 17', 'Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at', 'seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion,', 'of all things the most natural.  Her joy and expression', 'of regard long outlived her wonder.  He received the kindest', 'welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not', 'stand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him', 'before he entered the house, and they were quite overcome', 'by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man', 'could not very well be in love with either of her daughters,', 'without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the', 'satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.', 'His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all,', 'and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.', 'He was not in spirits, however; he praised their house,', 'admired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still', 'he was not in spirits.  The whole family perceived it,', 'and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality', 'in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all', 'selfish parents.', '\"What are Mrs. Ferrars\\'s views for you at present, Edward?\"', 'said she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round', 'the fire; \"are you still to be a great orator in spite of', 'yourself?\"', '\"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have', 'no more talents than inclination for a public life!\"', '\"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you', 'must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination', 'for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession,', 'and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.\"', '\"I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be', 'distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall.', 'Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence.\"', '\"You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes', 'are all moderate.\"', '\"As moderate as those of the rest of the world,', 'I believe.  I wish as well as every body else to be', 'perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be', 'in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.\"', '\"Strange that it would!\" cried Marianne.  \"What have', 'wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?\"', '\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth', 'has much to do with it.\"', '\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only', 'give happiness where there is nothing else to give it.', 'Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction,', 'as far as mere self is concerned.\"', '\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come', 'to the same point.  YOUR competence and MY wealth', 'are very much alike, I dare say; and without them,', 'as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every', 'kind of external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas', 'are only more noble than mine.  Come, what is your competence?\"', '\"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year;', 'not more than THAT.\"', 'Elinor laughed.  \"TWO thousand a year! ONE is my', 'wealth! I guessed how it would end.\"', '\"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\"', 'said Marianne.  \"A family cannot well be maintained on', 'a smaller.  I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands.', 'A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two,', 'and hunters, cannot be supported on less.\"', 'Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing', 'so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.', '\"Hunters!\" repeated Edward--\"but why must you have', 'hunters?  Every body does not hunt.\"', 'Marianne coloured as she replied, \"But most people do.\"', '\"I wish,\" said Margaret, striking out a novel thought,', '\"that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!\"', '\"Oh that they would!\" cried Marianne, her eyes', 'sparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing', 'with the delight of such imaginary happiness.', '\"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,\"', 'said Elinor, \"in spite of the insufficiency of wealth.\"', '\"Oh dear!\" cried Margaret, \"how happy I should be!', 'I wonder what I should do with it!\"', 'Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.', '\"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\"', 'said Mrs. Dashwood, \"if my children were all to be rich', 'my help.\"', '\"You must begin your improvements on this house,\"', 'observed Elinor, \"and your difficulties will soon vanish.\"', '\"What magnificent orders would travel from this family', 'to London,\" said Edward, \"in such an event!  What a happy', 'day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!  You,', 'Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every', 'new print of merit to be sent you--and as for Marianne,', 'I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough', 'in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,', 'Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she', 'would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their', 'falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every', 'book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.', 'Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very saucy.', 'But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our', 'old disputes.\"', '\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it', 'be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it--and you', 'will never offend me by talking of former times.', 'You are very right in supposing how my money would be', 'spent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly', 'be employed in improving my collection of music and books.\"', '\"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out', 'in annuities on the authors or their heirs.\"', '\"No, Edward, I should have something else to do', 'with it.\"', '\"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that', 'person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim,', 'that no one can ever be in love more than once in their', 'life--your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?\"', '\"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.', 'It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to', 'change them.\"', '\"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,\" said Elinor,', '\"she is not at all altered.\"', '\"She is only grown a little more grave than she was.\"', '\"Nay, Edward,\" said Marianne, \"you need not reproach me.', 'You are not very gay yourself.\"', '\"Why should you think so!\" replied he, with a sigh.', '\"But gaiety never was a part of MY character.\"', '\"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne\\'s,\" said Elinor;', '\"I should hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest,', 'very eager in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal', 'and always with animation--but she is not often really merry.\"', '\"I believe you are right,\" he replied, \"and yet I', 'have always set her down as a lively girl.\"', '\"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\"', 'said Elinor, \"in a total misapprehension of character in some', 'point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave,', 'or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can', 'hardly tell why or in what the deception originated.', 'Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves,', 'and very frequently by what other people say of them,', 'without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.\"', '\"But I thought it was right, Elinor,\" said Marianne,', '\"to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people.', 'I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient', 'to those of neighbours.  This has always been your doctrine,', 'I am sure.\"', '\"No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed', 'at the subjection of the understanding.  All I have', 'ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour.', 'You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,', 'of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance', 'in general with greater attention; but when have I advised', 'you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their', 'judgment in serious matters?\"', '\"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your', 'plan of general civility,\" said Edward to Elinor, \"Do you gain', 'no ground?\"', '\"Quite the contrary,\" replied Elinor,', 'looking expressively at Marianne.', '\"My judgment,\" he returned, \"is all on your side', 'of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much', \"more on your sister's.  I never wish to offend, but I\", 'am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent,', 'when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.', 'I have frequently thought that I must have been intended', 'by nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at', 'my ease among strangers of gentility!\"', '\"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention', 'of hers,\" said Elinor.', '\"She knows her own worth too well for false shame,\"', 'replied Edward.  \"Shyness is only the effect of a sense', 'of inferiority in some way or other.  If I could persuade', 'myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful,', 'I should not be shy.\"', '\"But you would still be reserved,\" said Marianne,', '\"and that is worse.\"', 'Edward started--\"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?\"', '\"Yes, very.\"', '\"I do not understand you,\" replied he, colouring.', '\"Reserved!--how, in what manner?  What am I to tell you?', 'What can you suppose?\"', 'Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying', 'to laugh off the subject, she said to him, \"Do not you', 'know my sister well enough to understand what she means?', 'Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not', 'talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously', 'as herself?\"', 'Edward made no answer.  His gravity and thoughtfulness', 'returned on him in their fullest extent--and he sat', 'for some time silent and dull.', 'CHAPTER 18', 'Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits', 'of her friend.  His visit afforded her but a very', 'partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it', 'appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he was unhappy;', 'she wished it were equally evident that he still', 'distinguished her by the same affection which once', 'she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the', 'continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain;', 'and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted', 'one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding', 'one.', 'He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room', 'the next morning before the others were down; and Marianne,', 'who was always eager to promote their happiness as far', 'as she could, soon left them to themselves.  But before she', 'was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and,', 'turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself come out.', '\"I am going into the village to see my horses,\"', 'said be, \"as you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall', 'be back again presently.\"', '                    ***', 'Edward returned to them with fresh admiration', 'of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village,', 'he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage;', 'and the village itself, in a much higher situation than', 'the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had', 'exceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured', \"Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe\", 'her own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more', 'minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him,', 'when Edward interrupted her by saying, \"You must not', 'enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge', 'in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance', 'and want of taste if we come to particulars.  I shall call', 'hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange', 'and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged;', 'and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be', 'indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.', 'You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can', 'honestly give.  I call it a very fine country--the', 'hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,', 'and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich', 'meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here', 'and there.  It exactly answers my idea of a fine country,', 'because it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say it', 'is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can', 'easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories,', 'grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.', 'I know nothing of the picturesque.\"', '\"I am afraid it is but too true,\" said Marianne;', '\"but why should you boast of it?\"', '\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind', 'of affectation, Edward here falls into another.  Because he', 'believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties', 'of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with', 'such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less', 'discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses.', 'He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"', '\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration', 'of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon.', 'Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with', 'the taste and elegance of him who first defined what', 'picturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind,', 'and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself,', 'because I could find no language to describe them', 'in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning.\"', '\"I am convinced,\" said Edward, \"that you really feel', 'all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess', 'to feel.  But, in return, your sister must allow me', 'to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,', 'but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked,', 'twisted, blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they', 'are tall, straight, and flourishing.  I do not like ruined,', 'tattered cottages.  I am not fond of nettles or thistles,', 'or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a snug', 'farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy,', 'happy villages please me better than the finest banditti', 'in the world.\"', 'Marianne looked with amazement at Edward,', 'with compassion at her sister.  Elinor only laughed.', 'The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne', 'remained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly', 'engaged her attention.  She was sitting by Edward, and', 'in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed', 'so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait', 'of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.', '\"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,\" she cried.', '\"Is that Fanny\\'s hair? I remember her promising to give', 'you some.  But I should have thought her hair had been darker.\"', 'Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--', 'but when she saw how much she had pained Edward, her own', 'vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed', 'by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary', 'glance at Elinor, replied, \"Yes; it is my sister\\'s hair.', 'The setting always casts a different shade on it,', 'you know.\"', 'Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.', 'That the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as', 'well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their', 'conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free', 'gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been', 'procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.', 'She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,', 'and affecting to take no notice of what passed,', 'by instantly talking of something else, she internally', 'resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing', 'the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt,', 'that it was exactly the shade of her own.', \"Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it\", 'ended in an absence of mind still more settled.', 'He was particularly grave the whole morning.', 'Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said;', 'but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,', 'had she known how little offence it had given her sister.', 'Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir', 'John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival', 'of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey', 'of the guest.  With the assistance of his mother-in-law,', 'Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of', 'Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine', 'of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but', 'the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have', 'prevented from being immediately sprung.  But, as it was,', 'she only learned, from some very significant looks, how far', \"their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions, extended.\", 'Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either', 'inviting them to dine at the park the next day, or to drink', 'tea with them that evening.  On the present occasion,', 'for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards', 'whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,', 'he wished to engage them for both.', '\"You MUST drink tea with us to night,\" said he,', '\"for we shall be quite alone--and tomorrow you must', 'absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party.\"', 'Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  \"And who knows', 'but you may raise a dance,\" said she.  \"And that will', 'tempt YOU, Miss Marianne.\"', '\"A dance!\" cried Marianne.  \"Impossible! Who is to dance?\"', '\"Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers', 'to be sure.--What! you thought nobody could dance', 'because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!\"', '\"I wish with all my soul,\" cried Sir John,', '\"that Willoughby were among us again.\"', \"This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions\", 'to Edward.  \"And who is Willoughby?\" said he, in a low voice,', 'to Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting.', \"She gave him a brief reply.  Marianne's countenance\", 'was more communicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend,', \"not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's\", 'expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their', 'visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said,', 'in a whisper, \"I have been guessing.  Shall I tell you', 'my guess?\"', '\"What do you mean?\"', '\"Shall I tell you.\"', '\"Certainly.\"', '\"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.\"', 'Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could', 'not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner,', \"and after a moment's silence, said,\", '\"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come', 'I hope...I am sure you will like him.\"', '\"I do not doubt it,\" replied he, rather astonished', 'at her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it', 'to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general,', 'founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby', 'and herself, he would not have ventured to mention it.', 'CHAPTER 19', 'Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly', 'pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he', 'were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved', 'to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at', 'the height.  His spirits, during the last two or three days,', 'though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew', 'more and more partial to the house and environs--never', 'spoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time', 'to be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he', 'should go when he left them--but still, go he must.', 'Never had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly', 'believe it to be gone.  He said so repeatedly; other things', 'he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave', 'the lie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland;', 'he detested being in town; but either to Norland or London,', 'he must go.  He valued their kindness beyond any thing,', 'and his greatest happiness was in being with them.', 'Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite', 'of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint', 'on his time.', 'Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this', \"way of acting to his mother's account; and it was\", 'happy for her that he had a mother whose character', 'was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general', 'excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.', 'Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes', 'displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself,', 'she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions', 'with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,', 'which had been rather more painfully extorted from her,', \"for Willoughby's service, by her mother.  His want of spirits,\", 'of openness, and of consistency, were most usually', 'attributed to his want of independence, and his better', \"knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs.\", 'The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose', 'in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination,', 'the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.', 'The old well-established grievance of duty against will,', 'parent against child, was the cause of all.  She would have', 'been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease,', 'this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would', 'be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.', 'But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort', \"to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection,\", 'to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word', 'which fell from him while at Barton, and above all', 'to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore', 'round his finger.', '\"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were', 'at breakfast the last morning, \"you would be a happier man', 'if you had any profession to engage your time and give', 'an interest to your plans and actions.  Some inconvenience', 'to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you', 'would not be able to give them so much of your time.', 'But (with a smile) you would be materially benefited', 'in one particular at least--you would know where to go', 'when you left them.\"', '\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long', 'thought on this point, as you think now.  It has been,', 'and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune', 'to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me,', 'no profession to give me employment, or afford me any', 'thing like independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety,', 'and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am,', 'an idle, helpless being.  We never could agree in our', 'choice of a profession.  I always preferred the church,', 'as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.', 'They recommended the army.  That was a great deal', 'too smart for me.  The law was allowed to be genteel', 'enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple,', 'made a very good appearance in the first circles,', 'and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had', 'no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse', 'study of it, which my family approved.  As for the navy,', 'it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the', 'subject was first started to enter it--and, at length,', 'as there was no necessity for my having any profession', 'at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without', 'a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced', 'on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable,', 'and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly', 'bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his', 'friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford', 'and have been properly idle ever since.\"', '\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\"', 'said Mrs. Dashwood, \"since leisure has not promoted', 'your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up', 'to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades', 'as Columella\\'s.\"', '\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent,', '\"to be as unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling,', 'in action, in condition, in every thing.\"', '\"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate', 'want of spirits, Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour,', 'and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.', 'But remember that the pain of parting from friends', 'will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their', 'education or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want', 'nothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name,', 'call it hope.  Your mother will secure to you, in time,', 'that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty,', 'and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to', 'prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.', 'How much may not a few months do?\"', '\"I think,\" replied Edward, \"that I may defy many', 'months to produce any good to me.\"', 'This desponding turn of mind, though it could not', 'be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain', 'to them all in the parting, which shortly took place,', \"and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's\", 'feelings especially, which required some trouble and time', 'to subdue.  But as it was her determination to subdue it,', 'and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than', 'what all her family suffered on his going away, she did', 'not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne,', 'on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow,', 'by seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means', 'were as different as their objects, and equally suited', 'to the advancement of each.', 'Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he', 'was out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day,', 'neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name,', 'appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the', 'general concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct,', 'she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented', 'from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters', 'were spared much solicitude on her account.', 'Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse', 'of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne,', 'than her own had seemed faulty to her.  The business', 'of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong', 'affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could', \"have no merit.  That her sister's affections WERE calm,\", 'she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it;', 'and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof,', 'by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite', 'of this mortifying conviction.', 'Without shutting herself up from her family,', 'or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them,', 'or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation,', 'Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough', \"to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every\", 'possible variety which the different state of her spirits', 'at different times could produce,--with tenderness,', 'pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.  There were moments', 'in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother', 'and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,', 'conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect', 'of solitude was produced.  Her mind was inevitably', 'at liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere;', 'and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting,', 'must be before her, must force her attention, and engross', 'her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.', 'From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her', 'drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after', \"Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of company.\", 'She happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the', 'little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front', 'of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw', 'a large party walking up to the door.  Amongst them', 'were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,', 'but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were', 'quite unknown to her.  She was sitting near the window,', 'and as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest', 'of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,', 'and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the', 'casement to speak to him, though the space was so short', 'between the door and the window, as to make it hardly', 'possible to speak at one without being heard at the other.', '\"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers.', 'How do you like them?\"', '\"Hush! they will hear you.\"', '\"Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.', 'Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her', 'if you look this way.\"', 'As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple', 'of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged', 'to be excused.', '\"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we', 'are come? I see her instrument is open.\"', '\"She is walking, I believe.\"', 'They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not', 'patience enough to wait till the door was opened before', 'she told HER story.  She came hallooing to the window,', '\"How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs. Dashwood do?', 'And where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you', 'will be glad of a little company to sit with you.', 'I have brought my other son and daughter to see you.', 'Only think of their coming so suddenly!  I thought I heard', 'a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,', 'but it never entered my head that it could be them.', 'I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel', 'Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think', 'I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come', 'back again\"--', 'Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle', 'of her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady', 'Middleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood', 'and Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they', 'all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings', 'continued her story as she walked through the passage', 'into the parlour, attended by Sir John.', 'Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady', 'Middleton, and totally unlike her in every respect.', 'She was short and plump, had a very pretty face,', 'and the finest expression of good humour in it that could', 'possibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant', \"as her sister's, but they were much more prepossessing.\", 'She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit,', 'except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away.', 'Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six', 'and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than', 'his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased.', 'He entered the room with a look of self-consequence,', 'slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word,', 'and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments,', 'took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it', 'as long as he staid.', 'Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed', 'by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy,', 'was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour', 'and every thing in it burst forth.', '\"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never', 'saw anything so charming!  Only think, Mamma, how it', 'is improved since I was here last! I always thought it', \"such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood)\", 'but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister,', 'how delightful every thing is! How I should like such', 'a house for myself!  Should not you, Mr. Palmer?\"', 'Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise', 'his eyes from the newspaper.', '\"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing;', '\"he never does sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!\"', 'This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had', 'never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one,', 'and could not help looking with surprise at them both.', 'Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud', 'as she could, and continued her account of their surprise,', 'the evening before, on seeing their friends, without', 'ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer laughed', 'heartily at the recollection of their astonishment,', 'and every body agreed, two or three times over, that it', 'had been quite an agreeable surprise.', '\"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\"', 'added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor,', 'and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard', 'by no one else, though they were seated on different sides', 'of the room; \"but, however, I can\\'t help wishing they had', 'not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey', 'of it, for they came all round by London upon account', 'of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and', 'pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation.', 'I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning,', 'but she would come with us; she longed so much to see', 'you all!\"', 'Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her', 'any harm.', '\"She expects to be confined in February,\"', 'continued Mrs. Jennings.', 'Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation,', 'and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there', 'was any news in the paper.', '\"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.', '\"Here comes Marianne,\" cried Sir John.  \"Now, Palmer,', 'you shall see a monstrous pretty girl.\"', 'He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door,', 'and ushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her,', 'as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham;', 'and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question,', 'as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer looked up', 'on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes,', \"and then returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer's eye\", 'was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room.', 'She got up to examine them.', '\"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!', 'Do but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming;', 'I could look at them for ever.\" And then sitting down again,', 'she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.', 'When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer', 'rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself', 'and looked at them all around.', '\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.', 'He made her no answer; and only observed, after again', 'examining the room, that it was very low pitched,', 'and that the ceiling was crooked.  He then made his bow,', 'and departed with the rest.', 'Sir John had been very urgent with them all to', 'spend the next day at the park.

But they had no', 'curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner,', 'and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way.', 'They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves;', 'the weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good.', 'But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should', 'be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too,', 'though she did not press their mother, pressed them.', 'Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all', 'seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young', 'ladies were obliged to yield.', '\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they', 'were gone.  \"The rent of this cottage is said to be low;', 'but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine', 'at the park whenever any one is staying either with them,', 'or with us.\"', '\"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\"', 'said Elinor, \"by these frequent invitations, than by', 'those which we received from them a few weeks ago.', 'The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown', 'tedious and dull.

They dined', 'with us last.\"', '\"You and I, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Jennings,', '\"should not stand upon such ceremony.\"', '\"Then you would be very ill-bred,\" cried Mr. Palmer.', '\"My love you contradict every body,\" said his wife', 'with her usual laugh.  \"Do you know that you are quite rude?\"', '\"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling', 'your mother ill-bred.\"', '\"Ay, you may abuse me as you please,\" said the good-natured', 'old lady, \"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot', 'give her back again.

It was impossible for any one to be more', 'thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy', 'than Mrs. Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence,', 'and discontent of her husband gave her no pain;', 'and when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted.', '\"Mr. Palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper,', 'to Elinor.  \"He is always out of humour.\"', 'Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation,', 'to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly', 'ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.', 'His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding,', 'like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable', 'bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly', 'woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too', 'common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.--', 'It was rather a wish of distinction, she believed,', 'which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body,', 'and his general abuse of every thing before him.', 'It was the desire of appearing superior to other people.', 'The motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means,', 'however they might succeed by establishing his superiority', 'in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him', 'except his wife.', '\"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards,', '\"I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.', 'Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this', 'Christmas?

He seems', 'an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing.\"', '\"So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it', 'is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull.', 'Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.--', 'I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he', 'hardly ever falls in love with any body.\"', '\"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part', 'of Somersetshire?\" said Elinor.', '\"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe', 'many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna', 'is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable', 'I assure you.  Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby', 'wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.', 'She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour;', 'not but that he is much more lucky in getting her,', 'because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing', \"can be good enough for her.

Their being her relations too', \"made it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts\", 'at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded,', 'when she advised her daughter not to care about their being', 'so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put', 'up with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to', 'prevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the', 'idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman,', 'contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle', 'reprimand on the subject five or six times every day.', 'The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by', 'no means ungenteel or unfashionable.

From such commendation as this, however,', 'there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew', 'that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met', 'with in every part of England, under every possible', 'variation of form, face, temper and understanding.', 'Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly', 'and look at his guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!

The manner in which Miss Steele had', 'spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck', 'her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion', \"of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something\", 'to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing,', \"for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by\", 'Miss Steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir', 'John.', 'CHAPTER 22', 'Marianne, who had never much toleration for any', 'thing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts,', 'or even difference of taste from herself, was at', 'this time particularly ill-disposed, from the state', 'of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles,', 'or to encourage their advances; and to the invariable', 'coldness of her behaviour towards them, which checked every', 'endeavour at intimacy on their side, Elinor principally', 'attributed that preference of herself which soon became', 'evident in the manners of both, but especially of Lucy,', 'who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation,', 'or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy', 'and frank communication of her sentiments.', 'Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often', 'just and amusing; and as a companion for half an hour', 'Elinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers', 'had received no aid from education: she was ignorant', 'and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,', 'her want of information in the most common particulars,', 'could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her', 'constant endeavour to appear to advantage.  Elinor saw,', 'and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education', 'might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less', 'tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,', 'of rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions,', 'her assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed;', 'and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company', 'of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance;', 'whose want of instruction prevented their meeting', 'in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct', 'toward others made every shew of attention and deference', 'towards herself perfectly valueless.', '\"You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,\"', 'said Lucy to her one day, as they were walking together', 'from the park to the cottage--\"but pray, are you', \"personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother,\", 'Mrs. Ferrars?\"', 'Elinor DID think the question a very odd one,', 'and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she', 'had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.', '\"Indeed!\" replied Lucy; \"I wonder at that, for I', 'thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes.', 'Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman', 'she is?\"', '\"No,\" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real', \"opinion of Edward's mother, and not very desirous\", 'of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity--', '\"I know nothing of her.\"', '\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring', 'about her in such a way,\" said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively', 'as she spoke; \"but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish', 'I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice', 'of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent.\"', 'Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on', 'for a few minutes in silence.  It was broken by Lucy,', 'who renewed the subject again by saying, with some', 'hesitation,', '\"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.', 'I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be', 'thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth', 'having as yours.

Can you be?\"', 'And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such', 'a sister-in-law.', '\"No,\" replied Lucy, \"not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I', 'never saw him in my life; but,\" fixing her eyes upon Elinor,', '\"to his eldest brother.\"', 'What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment,', 'that would have been as painful as it was strong, had not', 'an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it.', 'She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement, unable to divine', 'the reason or object of such a declaration; and though', 'her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity,', 'and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.', '\"You may well be surprised,\" continued Lucy;', '\"for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before;', 'for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it', 'to you or any of your family; because it was always meant', 'to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully', 'kept so by me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations', 'know of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned', 'it to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence', 'in the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my', 'behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars', 'must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.', 'And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased,', 'when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has', 'the highest opinion in the world of all your family,', 'and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite', 'as his own sisters.\"--She paused.', 'Elinor for a few moments remained silent.', 'Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too', 'great for words; but at length forcing herself to speak,', 'and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,', 'which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--', '\"May I ask if your engagement is of long standing?\"', '\"We have been engaged these four years.\"', '\"Four years!\"', '\"Yes.\"', 'Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable', 'to believe it.', '\"I did not know,\" said she, \"that you were even', 'acquainted till the other day.\"', '\"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.', 'He was under my uncle\\'s care, you know, a considerable while.\"', '\"Your uncle!\"', '\"Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk', 'of Mr. Pratt?\"', '\"I think I have,\" replied Elinor, with an exertion', 'of spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion.', '\"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple,', 'near Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun,', 'for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle,', 'and it was there our engagement was formed, though not till', 'a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost', 'always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter', 'into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and', 'approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved', 'him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.--', 'Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood,', 'you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is', 'very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"', '\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what', \"she said; but after a moment's reflection, she added,\", \"with revived security of Edward's honour and love,\", 'and her companion\\'s falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward', 'Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at', 'what you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon;', 'but surely there must be some mistake of person or name.', 'We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\"', '\"We can mean no other,\" cried Lucy, smiling.  \"Mr. Edward', 'Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street,', 'and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood,', 'is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely', 'to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness', 'depends.\"', '\"It is strange,\" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity,', '\"that I should never have heard him even mention your name.\"', '\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange.', 'Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.--', 'You knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore,', 'there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name', 'to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his', \"sister's suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough\", 'for his not mentioning it.\"', \"She was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but her\", 'self-command did not sink with it.', '\"Four years you have been engaged,\" said she', 'with a firm voice.', '\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have', 'to wait.  Poor Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart.\"', 'Then taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added,', '\"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look', 'at this face.  It does not do him justice, to be sure,', 'but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person', 'it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years.\"', 'She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor', 'saw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a', 'too hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood', 'might suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of', \"its being Edward's face.  She returned it almost instantly,\", 'acknowledging the likeness.', '\"I have never been able,\" continued Lucy, \"to give', 'him my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at,', 'for he has been always so anxious to get it!  But I am', 'determined to set for it the very first opportunity.\"', '\"You are quite in the right,\" replied Elinor calmly.', 'They then proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.', '\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world', 'of your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must', 'know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach', 'his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say.', 'I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding', 'proud woman.\"', '\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor;', '\"but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I', 'may be depended on.  Your secret is safe with me;', 'but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary', 'a communication.  You must at least have felt that my', 'being acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"', 'As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy,', 'hoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the', 'falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;', \"but Lucy's countenance suffered no change.\", '\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great', 'liberty with you,\" said she, \"in telling you all this.', 'I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least,', 'but I have known you and all your family by description', 'a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if', 'you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case,', 'I really thought some explanation was due to you after my', \"making such particular inquiries about Edward's mother;\", 'and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose', 'advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that knows of it,', 'and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great', 'deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her', 'betraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue,', 'as you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest', \"fright in the world t'other day, when Edward's name was\", 'mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all.', \"You can't think how much I go through in my mind from\", 'it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what', \"I have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.\", 'Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing', 'him so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year.', 'I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke.\"', 'Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did', 'not feel very compassionate.', '\"Sometimes.\" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes,', '\"I think whether it would not be better for us both', 'to break off the matter entirely.\"  As she said this,', 'she looked directly at her companion.  \"But then', 'at other times I have not resolution enough for it.--', 'I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable,', 'as I know the very mention of such a thing would do.', \"And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I don't\", 'think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise', 'me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you', 'do yourself?\"', '\"Pardon me,\" replied Elinor, startled by the question;', '\"but I can give you no advice under such circumstances.', 'Your own judgment must direct you.\"', '\"To be sure,\" continued Lucy, after a few minutes', 'silence on both sides, \"his mother must provide for him', 'sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it!', 'Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at', 'Barton?  He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple,', 'to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill.\"', '\"Did he come from your uncle\\'s, then, when he visited us?\"', '\"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.', 'Did you think he came directly from town?\"', '\"No,\" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of', \"every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity;\", '\"I remember he told us, that he had been staying', 'a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\"', 'She remembered too, her own surprise at the time,', 'at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends,', 'at his total silence with respect even to their names.', '\"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\"', 'repeated Lucy.', '\"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"', '\"I begged him to exert himself for fear you', 'should suspect what was the matter; but it made him', 'so melancholy, not being able to stay more than a', 'fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.--', 'Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now;', 'for he writes in wretched spirits.  I heard from him just', 'before I left Exeter;\" taking a letter from her pocket', 'and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.', '\"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is;', 'but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired,', 'I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full', 'as possible.\"', 'Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt', 'no longer.  This picture, she had allowed herself to believe,', 'might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have', \"been Edward's gift; but a correspondence between them\", 'by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement,', 'could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she', 'was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she could', 'hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary;', 'and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression', 'of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for', 'the time complete.', '\"Writing to each other,\" said Lucy, returning the', 'letter into her pocket, \"is the only comfort we have', 'in such long separations.  Yes, I have one other comfort', 'in his picture, but poor Edward has not even THAT.', 'If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.', 'I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at', 'Longstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said,', 'but not equal to a picture.  Perhaps you might notice', 'the ring when you saw him?\"', '\"I did,\" said Elinor, with a composure of voice,', 'under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond', 'any thing she had ever felt before.  She was mortified,', 'shocked, confounded.', 'Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage,', 'and the conversation could be continued no farther.', 'After sitting with them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles', 'returned to the Park, and Elinor was then at liberty', 'to think and be wretched.', '[At this point in the first and second editions, Volume 1 ends.]', 'CHAPTER 23', \"However small Elinor's general dependence on\", \"Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her\", 'on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case,', 'where no temptation could be answerable to the folly', 'of inventing a falsehood of such a description.  What Lucy', 'had asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not,', 'dared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every', 'side by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted', 'by nothing but her own wishes.  Their opportunity of', 'acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation', \"for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's\", 'visit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind,', 'his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain', 'behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the', 'Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections,', 'which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,', 'the ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence,', 'as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,', 'and established as a fact, which no partiality could', 'set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment', 'of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,', 'for a short time made her feel only for herself;', 'but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.', 'Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had he feigned', 'a regard for her which he did not feel?  Was his engagement', 'to Lucy an engagement of the heart?  No; whatever it might', 'once have been, she could not believe it such at present.', 'His affection was all her own.  She could not be deceived', 'in that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been', 'conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not', 'an illusion of her own vanity.  He certainly loved her.', 'What a softener of the heart was this persuasion!  How much', 'could it not tempt her to forgive!  He had been blamable,', 'highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first', 'felt her influence over him to be more than it ought', 'to be.  In that, he could not be defended; but if he', 'had injured her, how much more had he injured himself;', 'if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless.', 'His imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it', 'seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever', 'being otherwise.  She might in time regain tranquillity;', 'but HE, what had he to look forward to?  Could he', 'ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he,', 'were his affection for herself out of the question,', 'with his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind,', 'be satisfied with a wife like her--illiterate, artful,', 'and selfish?', 'The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally', 'blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature;', 'but the four succeeding years--years, which if rationally', 'spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must', 'have opened his eyes to her defects of education,', 'while the same period of time, spent on her side', 'in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits,', 'had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might', 'once have given an interesting character to her beauty.', 'If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself,', 'his difficulties from his mother had seemed great,', 'how much greater were they now likely to be, when', 'the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior', 'in connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.', 'These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated', 'from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience;', 'but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the', 'expectation of family opposition and unkindness, could', 'be felt as a relief!', 'As these considerations occurred to her in painful', 'succession, she wept for him, more than for herself.', 'Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to', 'merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief', 'that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem,', 'she thought she could even now, under the first smart', 'of the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every', 'suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters.', 'And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,', 'that when she joined them at dinner only two hours', 'after she had first suffered the extinction of all her', 'dearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the', 'appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning', 'in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever', 'from the object of her love, and that Marianne was', 'internally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose', 'whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she', 'expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.', 'The necessity of concealing from her mother and', 'Marianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to herself,', 'though it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no', \"aggravation of Elinor's distress.  On the contrary\", 'it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication', 'of what would give such affliction to them, and to be', 'saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward,', 'which would probably flow from the excess of their partial', 'affection for herself, and which was more than she felt', 'equal to support.', 'From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew', 'she could receive no assistance, their tenderness and', 'sorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command', 'would neither receive encouragement from their example', 'nor from their praise.  She was stronger alone,', 'and her own good sense so well supported her, that her', 'firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness', 'as invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh,', 'it was possible for them to be.', 'Much as she had suffered from her first conversation', 'with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish', 'of renewing it; and this for more reasons than one.', 'She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement', 'repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand', 'what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any', 'sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him,', 'and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her', 'readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness', 'in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested', 'in it than as a friend, which she very much feared', 'her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse,', 'must have left at least doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed', 'to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain', 'that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise,', \"not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing\", 'to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance,', 'with a secret so confessedly and evidently important.', \"And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had\", 'some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor remained so well', 'assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward,', 'it required no other consideration of probabilities', 'to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous;', 'and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.', 'What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could', \"there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's\", 'superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him', 'in future?  She had little difficulty in understanding thus', \"much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly\", 'resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and', 'honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward', 'and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny', 'herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy', 'that her heart was unwounded.  And as she could now have', 'nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already', 'been told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going', 'through a repetition of particulars with composure.', 'But it was not immediately that an opportunity', 'of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well', 'disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred;', 'for the weather was not often fine enough to allow', 'of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily', 'separate themselves from the others; and though they', 'met at least every other evening either at the park', 'or cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could', 'not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.', 'Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady', \"Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure\", 'was ever given for a general chat, and none at all for', 'particular discourse.  They met for the sake of eating,', 'drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,', 'or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.', 'One or two meetings of this kind had taken place,', 'without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy', 'in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning,', 'to beg, in the name of charity, that they would all', 'dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged', 'to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be', 'quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.', 'Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she', 'had in view, in such a party as this was likely to be,', 'more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil', 'and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when', 'her husband united them together in one noisy purpose,', 'immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her', \"mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne,\", 'though always unwilling to join any of their parties,', 'was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her', 'seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.', 'The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily', 'preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her.', 'The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor', 'had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought', 'or expression, and nothing could be less interesting', 'than the whole of their discourse both in the dining', 'parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children', 'accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was', \"too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy's\", 'attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the', 'removal of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed,', 'and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever', 'entertained a hope of finding time for conversation', 'at the park.  They all rose up in preparation for a round game.', '\"I am glad,\" said Lady Middleton to Lucy,', '\"you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria\\'s', 'basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your', 'eyes to work filigree by candlelight.

I shall go to the piano-forte;', 'I have not touched it since it was tuned.\"  And without', 'farther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.', 'Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven', 'that SHE had never made so rude a speech.', '\"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument', 'you know, ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth', 'away the offence; \"and I do not much wonder at it; for it', 'is the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard.\"', 'The remaining five were now to draw their cards.', '\"Perhaps,\" continued Elinor, \"if I should happen', 'to cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele,', 'in rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still', 'to be done to the basket, that it must be impossible', 'I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.', 'I should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow', 'me a share in it.\"', '\"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you', 'for your help,\" cried Lucy, \"for I find there is more', 'to be done to it than I thought there was; and it would', 'be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all.\"', '\"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\" said Miss Steele--', '\"Dear little soul, how I do love her!\"', '\"You are very kind,\" said Lady Middleton to Elinor;', '\"and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be', 'as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber,', 'or will you take your chance now?\"', 'Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals,', 'and thus by a little of that address which Marianne', 'could never condescend to practise, gained her own end,', 'and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time.  Lucy made room', 'for her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were', 'thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the', 'utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.', 'The pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own', 'music and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten', 'that any body was in the room besides herself, was luckily', 'so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely,', 'under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting', 'subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.', 'CHAPTER 24', 'In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.', '\"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have', 'honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance,', 'or no farther curiosity on its subject.

A short, a very', \"short time however must now decide what Willoughby's\", 'intentions were; in all probability he was already in town.', \"Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence\", 'on finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon', 'gaining every new light as to his character which her', 'own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,', 'but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister', 'with such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was', 'and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.', 'Should the result of her observations be unfavourable,', 'she was determined at all events to open the eyes', 'of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions', 'would be of a different nature--she must then learn', 'to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret', 'which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.', \"They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's\", 'behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what', 'future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings', 'might be expected to be.

Elinor said no more; it immediately', 'struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;', 'and the conclusion which as instantly followed was,', 'that, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct', 'the affair, they must be engaged.  This conviction,', 'though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure,', 'and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.', \"Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes;\", 'in length it could be no more than a note; it was then', 'folded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity.', 'Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in', 'the direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne,', 'ringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it', 'to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post.', 'This decided the matter at once.', 'Her spirits still continued very high; but there', 'was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much', 'pleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as', 'the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any dinner,', 'and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room,', 'seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.', 'It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings,', 'by being much engaged in her own room, could see little', 'of what was passing.  The tea things were brought in,', 'and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once', 'by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly', 'heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house,', \"Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach,\", 'and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door.', 'Every thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds;', 'she opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs,', 'and after listening half a minute, returned into the room', 'in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard', 'him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her', 'feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming,', '\"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed', 'almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel', 'Brandon appeared.', 'It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness,', 'and she immediately left the room.

So surprised at their coming to town,', 'though it was what she had rather expected all along;', \"so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation\", 'after having declined her own, though at the same time', 'she would never have forgiven them if they had not come!', '\"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,\"', 'said she; \"What do you think he said when he heard', 'of your coming with Mamma?  I forget what it was now,', 'but it was something so droll!\"', 'After an hour or two spent in what her mother called', 'comfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry', \"concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side,\", \"and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer's, it was\", 'proposed by the latter that they should all accompany', 'her to some shops where she had business that morning,', 'to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented,', 'as having likewise some purchases to make themselves;', 'and Marianne, though declining it at first was induced', 'to go likewise.', 'Wherever they went, she was evidently always on', 'the watch.  In Bond Street especially, where much of', 'their business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry;', 'and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was', 'equally abstracted from every thing actually before them,', 'from all that interested and occupied the others.', 'Restless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could', 'never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase,', 'however it might equally concern them both: she received', 'no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at', 'home again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation', 'at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught', 'by every thing pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild', 'to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her', 'time in rapture and indecision.', 'It was late in the morning before they returned home;', 'and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew', 'eagerly up stairs, and when Elinor followed, she found', 'her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance,', 'which declared that no Willoughby had been there.', '\"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?\"', 'said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels.', 'She was answered in the negative.  \"Are you quite sure', 'of it?\" she replied.  \"Are you certain that no servant,', 'no porter has left any letter or note?\"', 'The man replied that none had.', '\"How very odd!\" said she, in a low and disappointed', 'voice, as she turned away to the window.', '\"How odd, indeed!\" repeated Elinor within herself,', 'regarding her sister with uneasiness.  \"If she had not', 'known him to be in town she would not have written to him,', 'as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;', 'and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither', 'come nor write!  Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong', 'in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young,', 'a man so little known, to be carried on in so doubtful,', 'so mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how will MY', 'interference be borne.\"', 'She determined, after some consideration, that if', 'appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they', 'now were, she would represent in the strongest manner', 'to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the', 'affair.', \"Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's\", 'intimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited', 'in the morning, dined with them.  The former left them', 'soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements;', 'and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table', 'for the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions,', 'as she would never learn the game; but though her time', 'was therefore at her own disposal, the evening was by no', 'means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor,', 'for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the', 'pain of disappointment.  She sometimes endeavoured for a', 'few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside,', 'and she returned to the more interesting employment', 'of walking backwards and forwards across the room,', 'pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window,', 'in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.', 'CHAPTER 27', '\"If this open weather holds much longer,\" said Mrs. Jennings,', 'when they met at breakfast the following morning,', '\"Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week;', \"'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day's pleasure.\", 'Poor souls!  I always pity them when they do; they seem', 'to take it so much to heart.\"', '\"That is true,\" cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice,', 'and walking to the window as she spoke, to examine the day.', '\"I had not thought of that.  This weather will keep many', 'sportsmen in the country.\"', 'It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were', 'restored by it.  \"It is charming weather for THEM indeed,\"', 'she continued, as she sat down to the breakfast table', 'with a happy countenance.  \"How much they must enjoy', 'it! But\" (with a little return of anxiety) \"it cannot', 'be expected to last long.  At this time of the year,', 'and after such a series of rain, we shall certainly', 'have very little more of it.  Frosts will soon set in,', 'and in all probability with severity.  In another day', 'or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last', 'longer--nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight!\"', '\"At any rate,\" said Elinor, wishing to prevent', \"Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly\", 'as she did, \"I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady', 'Middleton in town by the end of next week.\"', '\"Ay, my dear, I\\'ll warrant you we do.  Mary always', 'has her own way.\"', '\"And now,\" silently conjectured Elinor, \"she will', 'write to Combe by this day\\'s post.\"', 'But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away', 'with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain', 'the fact.  Whatever the truth of it might be, and far', 'as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it,', 'yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could not be', 'very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits;', 'happy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier', 'in her expectation of a frost.', 'The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at', \"the houses of Mrs. Jennings's acquaintance to inform\", 'them of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time', 'busy in observing the direction of the wind, watching the', 'variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.', '\"Don\\'t you find it colder than it was in the morning,', 'Elinor? There seems to me a very decided difference.', 'I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff.  It was', 'not so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seem parting too,', 'the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a', 'clear afternoon.\"', 'Elinor was alternately diverted and pained;', 'but Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the', 'brightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance', 'of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.', 'The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be', \"dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and set\", 'of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves,', 'which was invariably kind.  Every thing in her household', 'arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan,', 'and excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady', \"Middleton's regret, she had never dropped, she visited\", 'no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose', 'the feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to find', 'herself more comfortably situated in that particular than', 'she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound', 'for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their', 'evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad,', 'formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.', 'Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation', 'to the house, was with them almost every day; he came', 'to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived', 'more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any', 'other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time', 'with much concern his continued regard for her sister.', 'She feared it was a strengthening regard.  It grieved her', 'to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne,', 'and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton.', 'About a week after their arrival, it became', 'certain that Willoughby was also arrived.  His card', \"was on the table when they came in from the morning's drive.\", '\"Good God!\" cried Marianne, \"he has been here while', 'we were out.\"  Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his', 'being in London, now ventured to say, \"Depend upon it,', 'he will call again tomorrow.\"  But Marianne seemed', \"hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenning's entrance,\", 'escaped with the precious card.', 'This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor,', 'restored to those of her sister all, and more than all,', 'their former agitation.  From this moment her mind was', 'never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour', 'of the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted', 'on being left behind, the next morning, when the others', 'went out.', \"Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing\", \"in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment's\", 'glance at her sister when they returned was enough to', 'inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there.', 'A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table,', '\"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.', '\"No, ma\\'am, for my mistress.\"', 'But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.', '\"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\"', '\"You are expecting a letter, then?\" said Elinor,', 'unable to be longer silent.', '\"Yes, a little--not much.\"', 'After a short pause.  \"You have no confidence', 'in me, Marianne.\"', '\"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have', 'confidence in no one!\"', '\"Me!\" returned Elinor in some confusion; \"indeed,', 'Marianne, I have nothing to tell.\"', '\"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations', 'then are alike.  We have neither of us any thing to tell;', 'you, because you do not communicate, and I, because', 'I conceal nothing.\"', 'Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself,', 'which she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how,', 'under such circumstances, to press for greater openness', 'in Marianne.', 'Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being', 'given her, she read it aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton,', 'announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before,', 'and requesting the company of her mother and cousins', \"the following evening.  Business on Sir John's part,\", 'and a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling', 'in Berkeley Street.  The invitation was accepted;', 'but when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as', 'it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that they', 'should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some', 'difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still', 'she had seen nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was', 'not more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling', 'to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.', 'Elinor found, when the evening was over,', 'that disposition is not materially altered by a change', 'of abode, for although scarcely settled in town,', 'Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty', 'young people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was', 'an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.', 'In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;', 'but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more', 'important and less easily attained, it was risking too much', 'for the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that', 'Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple,', 'with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.', 'Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former,', 'whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town,', 'as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention', 'to his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her,', 'they received no mark of recognition on their entrance.', 'He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know', 'who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from', 'the other side of the room.  Marianne gave one glance', 'round the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE', 'was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed', 'to receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been', 'assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards', 'the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them', 'in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first informed', 'of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said', 'something very droll on hearing that they were to come.', '\"I thought you were both in Devonshire,\" said he.', '\"Did you?\" replied Elinor.', '\"When do you go back again?\"', '\"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.', 'Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance', 'in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much', 'fatigued by the exercise.  She complained of it', 'as they returned to Berkeley Street.', '\"Aye, aye,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"we know the reason', 'of all that very well; if a certain person who shall', 'be nameless, had been there, you would not have been a', 'bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty', 'of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"', '\"Invited!\" cried Marianne.', '\"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir', 'John met him somewhere in the street this morning.\"', 'Marianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt.', 'Impatient in this situation to be doing something', \"that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved\", 'to write the next morning to her mother, and hoped', 'by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne,', 'to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed;', 'and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure', 'by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne', 'was again writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose', 'it to be to any other person.', 'About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by', 'herself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly,', 'while Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious', 'for conversation, walked from one window to the other,', 'or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.', 'Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother,', 'relating all that had passed, her suspicions of', \"Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her by every plea\", 'of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account', 'of her real situation with respect to him.', 'Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap', 'foretold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced.', 'Marianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated', 'company of any kind, left the room before he entered it.', 'He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing', 'satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he', 'had somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some', 'time without saying a word.  Elinor, persuaded that he', 'had some communication to make in which her sister', 'was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.', 'It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind', 'of conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with', 'the observation of \"your sister looks unwell to-day,\"', 'or \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had appeared', 'on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,', 'something particular about her.  After a pause of several', 'minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her', 'in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate', 'her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not', 'prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready,', 'was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient,', 'of asking what he meant?  He tried to smile as he replied,', '\"your sister\\'s engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally', 'known.\"', '\"It cannot be generally known,\" returned Elinor,', '\"for her own family do not know it.\"', 'He looked surprised and said, \"I beg your pardon,', 'I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not', 'supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond,', 'and their marriage is universally talked of.\"', '\"How can that be? By whom can you have heard', 'it mentioned?\"', '\"By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others', 'with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer,', 'and the Middletons.  But still I might not have believed it,', 'for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to', 'be convinced, it will always find something to support', 'its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,', 'accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to', \"Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing.  I came to inquire,\", 'but I was convinced before I could ask the question.', 'Is every thing finally settled?  Is it impossible to-?', 'But I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding.', 'Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong', 'in saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on', 'your prudence I have the strongest dependence.  Tell me', 'that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt,', 'that in short concealment, if concealment be possible,', 'is all that remains.\"', 'These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal', 'of his love for her sister, affected her very much.', 'She was not immediately able to say anything, and even', 'when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short', 'time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.', 'The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister', 'was so little known to herself, that in endeavouring', 'to explain it, she might be as liable to say too much', \"as too little.  Yet as she was convinced that Marianne's\", 'affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel', \"Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection\", 'might be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct', 'from censure, she thought it most prudent and kind,', 'after some consideration, to say more than she really knew', 'or believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that though', 'she had never been informed by themselves of the terms', 'on which they stood with each other, of their mutual', 'affection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence', 'she was not astonished to hear.', 'He listened to her with silent attention, and on', 'her ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat,', 'and after saying in a voice of emotion, \"to your sister', 'I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he', 'may endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away.', 'Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this', 'conversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on', 'other points; she was left, on the contrary, with a', \"melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's unhappiness,\", 'and was prevented even from wishing it removed,', 'by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.', 'CHAPTER 28', 'Nothing occurred during the next three or four days,', 'to make Elinor regret what she had done, in applying', 'to her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote.', 'They were engaged about the end of that time to attend', 'Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was', 'kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter;', 'and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited,', 'careless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent', 'whether she went or staid, prepared, without one look', 'of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the', 'drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady', \"Middleton's arrival, without once stirring from her seat,\", 'or altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts,', \"and insensible of her sister's presence; and when at\", 'last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them', 'at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that', 'any one was expected.', 'They arrived in due time at the place of destination,', 'and as soon as the string of carriages before them', 'would allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their', 'names announced from one landing-place to another in an', 'audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,', 'quite full of company, and insufferably hot.  When they had', 'paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady', 'of the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd,', 'and take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to', 'which their arrival must necessarily add.  After some time', 'spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat', 'down to Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for', 'moving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs,', 'placed themselves at no great distance from the table.', 'They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor', 'perceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards', 'of them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable', 'looking young woman.  She soon caught his eye, and he', 'immediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her,', 'or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;', 'and then continued his discourse with the same lady.', 'Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether', 'it could be unobserved by her.  At that moment she first', 'perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with', 'sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly,', 'had not her sister caught hold of her.', '\"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed, \"he is there--he', 'is there--Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot', 'I speak to him?\"', '\"Pray, pray be composed,\" cried Elinor, \"and do', 'not betray what you feel to every body present.', 'Perhaps he has not observed you yet.\"', 'This however was more than she could believe herself;', 'and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond', 'the reach of Marianne, it was beyond her wish.  She sat', 'in an agony of impatience which affected every feature.', 'At last he turned round again, and regarded them both;', 'she started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone', 'of affection, held out her hand to him.  He approached,', 'and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne,', 'as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to', 'observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after', 'Mrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town.', 'Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address,', 'and was unable to say a word.  But the feelings of her sister', 'were instantly expressed.  Her face was crimsoned over,', 'and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,', '\"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?', 'Have you not received my letters?  Will you not shake', 'hands with me?\"', 'He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed', 'painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.', 'During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure.', 'Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression', \"becoming more tranquil.  After a moment's pause, he spoke\", 'with calmness.', '\"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley', 'Street last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was', 'not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings', 'at home.  My card was not lost, I hope.\"', '\"But have you not received my notes?\" cried Marianne', 'in the wildest anxiety.  \"Here is some mistake I am', 'sure--some dreadful mistake.  What can be the meaning', \"of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me,\", 'what is the matter?\"', 'He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his', 'embarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye', 'of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking,', 'he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered', 'himself again, and after saying, \"Yes, I had the pleasure', 'of receiving the information of your arrival in town,', 'which you were so good as to send me,\" turned hastily away', 'with a slight bow and joined his friend.', 'Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable', 'to stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every', 'moment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the', 'observation of others, while reviving her with lavender water.', '\"Go to him, Elinor,\" she cried, as soon as she', 'could speak, \"and force him to come to me.  Tell him', 'I must see him again--must speak to him instantly.--', \"I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till this\", 'is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.--', 'Oh go to him this moment.\"', '\"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne,', 'you must wait.  This is not the place for explanations.', 'Wait only till tomorrow.\"', 'With difficulty however could she prevent her', 'from following him herself; and to persuade her to check', 'her agitation, to wait, at least, with the appearance', 'of composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy', 'and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued', 'incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery', 'of her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness.', 'In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the', 'door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he', 'was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again', 'that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.', 'She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady', 'Middleton to take them home, as she was too miserable', 'to stay a minute longer.', 'Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber,', 'on being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too', 'polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away,', 'and making over her cards to a friend, they departed', 'as soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word', 'was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.', 'Marianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even', 'for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home,', 'they could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn', 'restored her a little to herself.  She was soon undressed', 'and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone,', 'her sister then left her, and while she waited the return', 'of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over', 'the past.', 'That some kind of engagement had subsisted', 'between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt,', 'and that Willoughby was weary of it, seemed equally clear;', 'for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes,', 'SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake', 'or misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough', 'change of sentiment could account for it.  Her indignation', 'would have been still stronger than it was, had she', 'not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak', 'a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented', 'her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been', 'sporting with the affections of her sister from the first,', 'without any design that would bear investigation.', 'Absence might have weakened his regard, and convenience', 'might have determined him to overcome it, but that such', 'a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself', 'to doubt.', 'As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting', 'must already have given her, and on those still more', 'severe which might await her in its probable consequence,', 'she could not reflect without the deepest concern.', 'Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she', 'could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be', 'divided in future, her mind might be always supported.', 'But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil', 'seemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne', 'in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate', 'and irreconcilable rupture with him.', 'CHAPTER 29', 'Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day,', 'or the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning', 'in January, Marianne, only half dressed, was kneeling', 'against one of the window-seats for the sake of all', 'the little light she could command from it, and writing', 'as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her.', 'In this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation', 'and sobs, first perceived her; and after observing her', 'for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone', 'of the most considerate gentleness,', '\"Marianne, may I ask-?\"', '\"No, Elinor,\" she replied, \"ask nothing; you will', 'soon know all.\"', 'The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said,', 'lasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately', 'followed by a return of the same excessive affliction.', 'It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter,', 'and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her,', 'at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her', 'feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing', 'for the last time to Willoughby.', 'Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention', 'in her power; and she would have tried to sooth and', 'tranquilize her still more, had not Marianne entreated her,', 'with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability,', 'not to speak to her for the world.  In such circumstances,', 'it was better for both that they should not be long together;', \"and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented\", 'her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed,', 'but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place,', 'made her wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding', 'the sight of every body.', 'At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat', \"any thing; and Elinor's attention was then all employed,\", 'not in urging her, not in pitying her, nor in appearing', \"to regard her, but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning's\", 'notice entirely to herself.', 'As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings,', 'it lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting', 'themselves, after it, round the common working table, when a', 'letter was delivered to Marianne, which she eagerly caught', 'from the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness,', 'instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw as plainly', 'by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must', 'come from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness', 'at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head,', 'and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it', \"impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning's notice.  That good lady,\", 'however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter', 'from Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke,', 'and which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh,', \"that she would find it to her liking.  Of Elinor's distress,\", 'she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted', 'for her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing', 'her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,', '\"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so', 'desperately in love in my life!  MY girls were nothing', 'to her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as', 'for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.', \"I hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her\", 'waiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her', 'look so ill and forlorn.  Pray, when are they to be married?\"', 'Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at', 'that moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack', 'as this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, \"And have', \"you really, Ma'am, talked yourself into a persuasion\", \"of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  I thought\", 'it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems', 'to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not', 'deceive yourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing', 'would surprise me more than to hear of their being going', 'to be married.\"', '\"For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you', \"talk so?  Don't we all know that it must be a match, that\", 'they were over head and ears in love with each other from', 'the first moment they met?  Did not I see them together', 'in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I', 'know that your sister came to town with me on purpose', \"to buy wedding clothes?

A butcher hard by in the village,\", \"and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw.\", 'To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park,', 'where they are forced to send three miles for their meat,', 'and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother.', 'Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.', 'One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.', 'If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head!\"', '\"Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma\\'am,\" said Elinor,', '\"we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon.\"', 'And then rising, she went away to join Marianne,', 'whom she found, as she expected, in her own room, leaning,', 'in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire,', \"which, till Elinor's entrance, had been her only light.\", '\"You had better leave me,\" was all the notice', 'that her sister received from her.', '\"I will leave you,\" said Elinor, \"if you will go', 'to bed.\" But this, from the momentary perverseness', 'of impatient suffering, she at first refused to do.', \"Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,\", 'soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her', 'lay her aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped,', 'in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her.', 'In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired,', 'she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass,', 'full of something, in her hand.', '\"My dear,\" said she, entering, \"I have just recollected', 'that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the', 'house that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it', 'for your sister.  My poor husband! how fond he was of it!', 'Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said', 'it did him more good than any thing else in the world.', 'Do take it to your sister.\"', '\"Dear Ma\\'am,\" replied Elinor, smiling at the difference', 'of the complaints for which it was recommended, \"how good', 'you are!  But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope,', 'almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much', 'service to her as rest, if you will give me leave,', 'I will drink the wine myself.\"', 'Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been', 'five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise;', 'and Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected,', 'that though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present,', 'of little importance to her, its healing powers,', 'on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried', 'on herself as on her sister.', 'Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea,', 'and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne,', 'Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected', 'nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he', 'was already aware of what occasioned her absence.', 'Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought;', 'for soon after his entrance, she walked across the room', 'to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--', '\"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows', 'nothing of it; do tell him, my dear.\"', \"He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her's,\", 'and, with a look which perfectly assured her of his', 'good information, inquired after her sister.', '\"Marianne is not well,\" said she.  \"She has been', 'indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed.\"', '\"Perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what I', 'heard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it', 'than I could believe possible at first.\"', '\"What did you hear?\"', '\"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short,', 'that a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I', 'tell you?  If you know it already, as surely you must,', 'I may be spared.\"', '\"You mean,\" answered Elinor, with forced calmness,', '\"Mr. Willoughby\\'s marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO', 'know it all.  This seems to have been a day of general', 'elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us.', 'Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?\"', '\"In a stationer\\'s shop in Pall Mall, where I', 'had business.  Two ladies were waiting for their carriage,', 'and one of them was giving the other an account of the', 'intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,', 'that it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The name', 'of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated,', 'first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive', 'assertion that every thing was now finally settled', 'respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was no longer', 'to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,', 'with many particulars of preparations and other matters.', 'One thing, especially, I remember, because it served', 'to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony', 'was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat', 'in Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but it would be', 'impossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative', 'lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop', 'till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I', 'have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey\\'s guardian.\"', '\"It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey', 'has fifty thousand pounds?  In that, if in any thing,', 'we may find an explanation.\"', '\"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least', 'I think\"--he stopped a moment; then added in a voice', 'which seemed to distrust itself, \"And your sister--', 'how did she--\"', '\"Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have', 'only to hope that they may be proportionately short.', 'It has been, it is a most cruel affliction.  Till yesterday,', 'I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now,', 'perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was', 'really attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and,', 'in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\"', '\"Ah!\" said Colonel Brandon, \"there is, indeed!  But', 'your sister does not--I think you said so--she does', 'not consider quite as you do?\"', '\"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly', 'she would still justify him if she could.\"', 'He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal', 'of the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties,', 'the subject was necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had', 'watched them with pleasure while they were talking, and who', \"expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood's communication,\", \"in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon's side,\", 'as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of hope', 'and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole', 'evening more serious and thoughtful than usual.', 'CHAPTER 31', 'From a night of more sleep than she had expected,', 'Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness', 'of misery in which she had closed her eyes.', 'Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk', 'of what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had', 'gone through the subject again and again; and with the same', \"steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor's side,\", 'the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on', \"Marianne's, as before.  Sometimes she could believe\", 'Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself,', 'and at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility', 'of acquitting him.  At one moment she was absolutely', 'indifferent to the observation of all the world, at another', 'she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third', 'could resist it with energy.  In one thing, however,', 'she was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding,', 'where it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings,', 'and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it.', \"Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings's\", 'entering into her sorrows with any compassion.', '\"No, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried;', '\"she cannot feel.  Her kindness is not sympathy;', 'her good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she wants', 'is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\"', 'Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice', 'to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others,', 'by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too', 'great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a', 'strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.', 'Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there', 'be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent', 'abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither', 'reasonable nor candid.  She expected from other people', 'the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged', 'of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions', 'on herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the', 'sisters were together in their own room after breakfast,', 'which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower', 'in her estimation; because, through her own weakness,', 'it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,', 'though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse', 'of the utmost goodwill.', 'With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance', 'gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,', 'she entered their room, saying,', '\"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure', 'will do you good.\"', 'Marianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination', 'placed before her a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness', 'and contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory,', 'convincing; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself,', 'rushing eagerly into the room to inforce, at her feet,', 'by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter.', 'The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.', 'The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome,', 'was before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment', 'which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope,', 'she felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered.', 'The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within', 'her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence,', 'could have expressed; and now she could reproach her', 'only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with', 'passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely', 'lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity,', 'she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.', 'But the letter, when she was calm enough to read it,', 'brought little comfort.  Willoughby filled every page.', 'Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying', 'as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused', \"by Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater\", 'openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness', 'towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such', 'a conviction of their future happiness in each other,', 'that she wept with agony through the whole of it.', 'All her impatience to be at home again now returned;', 'her mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through', 'the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby,', 'and she was wildly urgent to be gone.  Elinor, unable herself', 'to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be', 'in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own', \"except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known;\", \"and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait\", 'for that knowledge.', 'Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she', 'could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able', 'to grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing', \"Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for the rest\", 'of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of', 'the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving,', \"by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying\", 'any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother', 'an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions', 'for the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room', \"on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table\", 'where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen,', 'grieving over her for the hardship of such a task,', 'and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.', 'In this manner they had continued about a quarter', 'of an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then', 'bear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.', '\"Who can this be?\" cried Elinor.  \"So early too! I', 'thought we HAD been safe.\"', 'Marianne moved to the window--', '\"It is Colonel Brandon!\" said she, with vexation.', '\"We are never safe from HIM.\"', '\"He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.\"', '\"I will not trust to THAT,\" retreating to her own room.', '\"A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no', 'conscience in his intrusion on that of others.\"', 'The event proved her conjecture right, though it', 'was founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon', 'DID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that', 'solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw', 'THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,', 'and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her,', 'could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly.', '\"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,\" said he,', 'after the first salutation, \"and she encouraged me', 'to come on; and I was the more easily encouraged,', 'because I thought it probable that I might find you alone,', 'which I was very desirous of doing.  My object--my', 'wish--my sole wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe', 'it is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, I must', 'not say comfort--not present comfort--but conviction,', \"lasting conviction to your sister's mind.  My regard for her,\", 'for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it,', 'by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY', 'sincere regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being', 'useful--I think I am justified--though where so many hours', 'have been spent in convincing myself that I am right,', 'is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?\"', 'He stopped.', '\"I understand you,\" said Elinor.  \"You have something', 'to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character', 'farther.  Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship', 'that can be shewn Marianne.  MY gratitude will be insured', 'immediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS', 'must be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let me hear it.\"', '\"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton', 'last October,--but this will give you no idea--I must go', 'farther back.  You will find me a very awkward narrator,', 'Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.  A short', 'account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it', 'SHALL be a short one.  On such a subject,\" sighing heavily,', '\"can I have little temptation to be diffuse.\"', 'He stopt a moment for recollection, and then,', 'with another sigh, went on.', '\"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--', '(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression', 'on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton', 'Park--it was the evening of a dance--in which I alluded', 'to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure,', 'your sister Marianne.\"', '\"Indeed,\" answered Elinor, \"I have NOT forgotten it.\"', 'He looked pleased by this remembrance, and added,', '\"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality', 'of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance', 'between them, as well in mind as person.  The same warmth', 'of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits.', 'This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from', 'her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.', 'Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years', 'we were playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the', 'time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her,', 'as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my', 'present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me', \"incapable of having ever felt.  Her's, for me, was, I believe,\", 'fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby', 'and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.', 'At seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was', 'married--married against her inclination to my brother.', 'Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.', 'And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the', 'conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.', 'My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.', 'I had hoped that her regard for me would support her', 'under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at', 'last the misery of her situation, for she experienced', 'great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though', 'she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I', 'relate!  I have never told you how this was brought on.', 'We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland.', \"The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us.\", 'I was banished to the house of a relation far distant,', 'and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,', \"till my father's point was gained.  I had depended on her\", 'fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--', 'but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was,', 'a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least', 'I should not have now to lament it.  This however', 'was not the case.  My brother had no regard for her;', 'his pleasures were not what they ought to have been,', 'and from the first he treated her unkindly.  The consequence', 'of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced', \"as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.  She resigned\", 'herself at first to all the misery of her situation;', 'and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those', 'regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we', 'wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy,', 'and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for', 'my father lived only a few months after their marriage,', 'and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she', 'should fall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I', 'meant to promote the happiness of both by removing', 'from her for years, and for that purpose had procured', 'my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,\"', 'he continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of', 'trifling weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard,', 'about two years afterwards, of her divorce.  It was', 'THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection', 'of what I suffered--\"', 'He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few', 'minutes about the room.  Elinor, affected by his relation,', 'and still more by his distress, could not speak.  He saw', 'her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it,', 'and kissed it with grateful respect.  A few minutes more', 'of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.', '\"It was nearly three years after this unhappy', 'period before I returned to England.  My first care,', 'when I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her;', 'but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.', 'I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there', 'was every reason to fear that she had removed from him', 'only to sink deeper in a life of sin.  Her legal allowance', 'was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her', 'comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that', 'the power of receiving it had been made over some months', 'before to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he', 'imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress,', 'had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief.', 'At last, however, and after I had been six months in England,', 'I DID find her.  Regard for a former servant of my own,', 'who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit', 'him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt;', 'and there, the same house, under a similar confinement,', 'was my unfortunate sister.  So altered--so faded--worn', 'down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I', 'believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me,', 'to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,', 'on whom I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding', 'her--but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting', 'to describe it--I have pained you too much already.', 'That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage', 'of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was', 'my greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her,', 'beyond giving time for a better preparation for death;', 'and that was given.  I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,', 'and under proper attendants; I visited her every day', 'during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her', 'last moments.\"', 'Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor', 'spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern,', 'at the fate of his unfortunate friend.', '\"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,\" said he,', '\"by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my', 'poor disgraced relation.  Their fates, their fortunes,', 'cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet', 'disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind,', 'or a happier marriage, she might have been all that you', 'will live to see the other be.  But to what does all this', 'lead?  I seem to have been distressing you for nothing.', 'Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched', 'for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!', 'I WILL be more collected--more concise.  She left to my care', 'her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first', 'guilty connection, who was then about three years old.', 'She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.', 'It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly', 'would I have discharged it in the strictest sense,', 'by watching over her education myself, had the nature', 'of our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home;', 'and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school.', 'I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my', 'brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which', 'left to me the possession of the family property,) she', 'visited me at Delaford.  I called her a distant relation;', 'but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected', 'of a much nearer connection with her.  It is now three', 'years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,)', 'that I removed her from school, to place her under the care', 'of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,', 'who had the charge of four or five other girls of about', 'the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason', 'to be pleased with her situation.  But last February,', 'almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.', 'I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned', 'out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of', 'her young friends, who was attending her father there', 'for his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,', 'and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,', 'for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy,', 'she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she', 'certainly knew all.  He, her father, a well-meaning,', 'but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,', 'give no information; for he had been generally confined', 'to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town', 'and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried', 'to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself,', \"of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business.\", 'In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone;', 'all the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.', 'What I thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I', 'suffered too.\"', '\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"could it be--could', 'Willoughby!\"--', '\"The first news that reached me of her,\" he continued,', '\"came in a letter from herself, last October.', 'It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it', 'on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell;', 'and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,', 'which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange', 'to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some.', 'Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his', 'looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party,', 'that I was called away to the relief of one whom he', 'had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it,', 'what would it have availed?  Would he have been less', 'gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?  No,', 'he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel', 'for another would do.  He had left the girl whose', 'youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of', 'the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,', 'no friends, ignorant of his address!  He had left her,', 'promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote,', 'nor relieved her.\"', '\"This is beyond every thing!\" exclaimed Elinor.', '\"His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated,', 'and worse than both.  Knowing all this, as I have now', 'known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing', 'your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured', 'that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt', 'for all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and', 'found you alone, I came determined to know the truth;', 'though irresolute what to do when it WAS known.', 'My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then;', 'but now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be', 'so deceived; to see your sister--but what could I do?', 'I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes', \"I thought your sister's influence might yet reclaim him.\", 'But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what', 'were his designs on her.  Whatever they may have been,', 'however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL', 'turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she', 'compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers', 'the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl,', 'and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong,', 'still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented', 'by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.', 'Surely this comparison must have its use with her.', 'She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They', 'proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.', 'On the contrary, every friend must be made still more', 'her friend by them.  Concern for her unhappiness,', 'and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen', 'every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however,', 'in communicating to her what I have told you.  You must', 'know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously,', 'and from my heart believed it might be of service,', 'might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered', 'myself to trouble you with this account of my family', 'afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been', 'intended to raise myself at the expense of others.\"', \"Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful\", 'earnestness; attended too with the assurance of her', 'expecting material advantage to Marianne, from the', 'communication of what had passed.', '\"I have been more pained,\" said she, \"by her', 'endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it', 'irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction', 'of his unworthiness can do.  Now, though at first she', 'will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.', 'Have you,\" she continued, after a short silence,', '\"ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton?\"', '\"Yes,\" he replied gravely, \"once I have.  One meeting', 'was unavoidable.\"', 'Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously,', 'saying,', '\"What? have you met him to--\"', '\"I could meet him no other way.  Eliza had confessed', 'to me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover;', 'and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight', 'after myself, we met by appointment, he to defend,', 'I to punish his conduct.  We returned unwounded,', 'and the meeting, therefore, never got abroad.\"', 'Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this;', 'but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it.', '\"Such,\" said Colonel Brandon, after a pause,', '\"has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother', 'and daughter! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust!\"', '\"Is she still in town?\"', '\"No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in,', 'for I found her near her delivery, I removed her and her', 'child into the country, and there she remains.\"', 'Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably', 'dividing Elinor from her sister, he put an end to his visit,', 'receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments,', 'and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him.', 'CHAPTER 32', 'When the particulars of this conversation were repeated', 'by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were,', 'the effect on her was not entirely such as the former', 'had hoped to see.  Not that Marianne appeared to distrust', 'the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all', 'with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither', 'objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby,', 'and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to', 'be impossible.  But though this behaviour assured Elinor', 'that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to', 'her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it,', 'in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,', 'in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking,', 'with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she', 'saw her spirits less violently irritated than before,', 'she did not see her less wretched.

He had just compunction', 'enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself,', 'to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should', 'do a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon,', 'or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means', 'of atoning for his own neglect.', 'They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton', 'at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.', 'Abundance of civilities passed on all sides.

But so little were they,', 'anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her,', 'that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole', 'day without hearing any other raillery on the subject,', 'than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself.', 'All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so', 'totally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought', 'it a delightful thing for the girls to be together;', 'and generally congratulated her young friends every night,', 'on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long.', \"She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes\", 'at her own house; but wherever it was, she always came', 'in excellent spirits, full of delight and importance,', \"attributing Charlotte's well doing to her own care, and ready\", 'to give so exact, so minute a detail of her situation,', 'as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.', 'One thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her', 'daily complaint.  Mr. Palmer maintained the common,', 'but unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike;', 'and though she could plainly perceive, at different times,', 'the most striking resemblance between this baby and every', 'one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing', 'his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it', 'was not exactly like every other baby of the same age;', 'nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple', 'proposition of its being the finest child in the world.', 'I come now to the relation of a misfortune,', 'which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood.', 'It so happened that while her two sisters with', 'Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street,', 'another of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance', 'in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her.', 'But while the imaginations of other people will carry', 'them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct,', \"and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness\", 'must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.', 'In the present instance, this last-arrived lady allowed', 'her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability,', 'that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods,', \"and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters,\", 'she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street;', 'and this misconstruction produced within a day', 'or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them', 'as well as for their brother and sister, to a small', 'musical party at her house.  The consequence of which was,', 'that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only', 'to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her', 'carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse,', 'must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing', 'to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they', 'might not expect to go out with her a second time?  The power', \"of disappointing them, it was true, must always be her's.\", 'But that was not enough; for when people are determined', 'on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel', 'injured by the expectation of any thing better from them.', 'Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much', 'into the habit of going out every day, that it was become', 'a matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not:', 'and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every', \"evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest\", 'amusement from any, and very often without knowing,', 'till the last moment, where it was to take her.', 'To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly', 'indifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it,', 'during the whole of her toilet, which it received from', 'Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being', 'together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute', 'observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing,', 'and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price', \"of every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the\", 'number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than', 'Marianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out', 'before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,', 'and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.', 'The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover,', 'was generally concluded with a compliment, which', 'though meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne', 'as the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing', 'an examination into the value and make of her gown,', 'the colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair,', 'she was almost sure of being told that upon \"her word', 'she looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would', 'make a great many conquests.\"', 'With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed', \"on the present occasion, to her brother's carriage;\", 'which they were ready to enter five minutes after it', 'stopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable', 'to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house', 'of her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay', 'on their part that might inconvenience either herself', 'or her coachman.', 'The events of this evening were not very remarkable.', 'The party, like other musical parties, comprehended a', 'great many people who had real taste for the performance,', 'and a great many more who had none at all; and the performers', 'themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,', 'and that of their immediate friends, the first private', 'performers in England.', 'As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so,', 'she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand', 'pianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even', 'by the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix', 'them at pleasure on any other object in the room.  In one', 'of these excursive glances she perceived among a group', 'of young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture', \"on toothpick-cases at Gray's.  She perceived him soon\", 'afterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly', 'to her brother; and had just determined to find out his', 'name from the latter, when they both came towards her,', 'and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.', 'He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted', 'his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as', 'words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb', 'she had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy had', 'it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended', 'less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest', \"relations!  For then his brother's bow must have given\", 'the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother', 'and sister would have begun.  But while she wondered', 'at the difference of the two young men, she did not find', 'that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out', 'of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other.', 'Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself', \"in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation;\", 'for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme', 'GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing', 'in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it', 'much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune', 'of a private education; while he himself, though probably', 'without any particular, any material superiority', 'by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,', 'was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.', '\"Upon my soul,\" he added, \"I believe it is nothing more;', 'and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving', \"about it.  'My dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'you must\", 'make yourself easy.  The evil is now irremediable,', 'and it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would', 'you be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your', 'own judgment, to place Edward under private tuition,', 'at the most critical time of his life?  If you had only sent', 'him to Westminster as well as myself, instead of sending', \"him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been prevented.'\", 'This is the way in which I always consider the matter,', 'and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\"', 'Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because,', 'whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage', \"of a public school, she could not think of Edward's\", \"abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.\", '\"You reside in Devonshire, I think,\"--was his', 'next observation, \"in a cottage near Dawlish.\"', 'Elinor set him right as to its situation;', 'and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody', 'could live in Devonshire, without living near Dawlish.', 'He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their', 'species of house.', '\"For my own part,\" said he, \"I am excessively fond', 'of a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much', 'elegance about them.  And I protest, if I had any money', 'to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself,', 'within a short distance of London, where I might drive', 'myself down at any time, and collect a few friends', 'about me, and be happy.  I advise every body who is going', 'to build, to build a cottage.  My friend Lord Courtland', 'came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,', \"and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's.\", \"I was to decide on the best of them.  'My dear Courtland,'\", \"said I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, 'do not\", \"adopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.'\", 'And that I fancy, will be the end of it.', '\"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations,', 'no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake.', \"I was last month at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford.\", \"Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  'But how can it\", \"be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it\", 'is to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage', \"that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?'\", 'I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it,', \"so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy.\", 'The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;', 'card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library', 'may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the', \"supper be set out in the saloon.'  Lady Elliott was delighted\", 'with the thought.  We measured the dining-room, and found', 'it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair', 'was arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact,', 'you see, if people do but know how to set about it,', 'every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage', 'as in the most spacious dwelling.\"', 'Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think', 'he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.', 'As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his', 'eldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on', 'any thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening,', 'which he communicated to his wife, for her approbation,', \"when they got home.  The consideration of Mrs. Dennison's\", 'mistake,', 'in supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the', 'propriety of their being really invited to become such,', \"while Mrs. Jenning's engagements kept her from home.\", 'The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more;', 'and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy', 'of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its', 'complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father.', 'Fanny was startled at the proposal.', '\"I do not see how it can be done,\" said she,', '\"without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day', 'with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it.', 'You know I am always ready to pay them any attention', 'in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.', \"But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.  How can I ask them\", 'away from her?\"', 'Her husband, but with great humility, did not see', 'the force of her objection.  \"They had already spent a week', 'in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton', 'could not be displeased at their giving the same number', 'of days to such near relations.\"', 'Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,', '\"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it', 'was in my power.  But I had just settled within myself', 'to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us.', 'They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think', 'the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very', 'well by Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year,', 'you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.', 'I am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them,', 'you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they', 'are such favourites with Harry!\"', 'Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity', 'of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience', 'was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters', 'another year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting', 'that another year would make the invitation needless,', \"by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife,\", 'and Marianne as THEIR visitor.', 'Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready', 'wit that had procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy,', \"to request her company and her sister's, for some days,\", 'in Harley Street, as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them.', 'This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy.', 'Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself;', 'cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!', 'Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was,', 'above all things, the most material to her interest,', 'and such an invitation the most gratifying to her', 'feelings!  It was an advantage that could not be too', 'gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of;', 'and the visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had', 'any precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been', \"always meant to end in two days' time.\", 'When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten', 'minutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time,', 'some share in the expectations of Lucy; for such a mark', 'of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance,', 'seemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose', 'from something more than merely malice against herself;', 'and might be brought, by time and address, to do', 'every thing that Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already', 'subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry', 'into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and these', 'were effects that laid open the probability of greater.', 'The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all', 'that reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened', 'her expectation of the event.  Sir John, who called on', 'them more than once, brought home such accounts of the', 'favour they were in, as must be universally striking.', 'Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any', 'young women in her life, as she was with them; had given', 'each of them a needle book made by some emigrant;', 'called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know', 'whether she should ever be able to part with them.', '[At this point in the first and second edtions, Volume II ended.]', 'CHAPTER 37', 'Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight,', 'that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up', 'the whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with', 'visiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period', 'to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found', 'the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.', 'About the third or fourth morning after their', 'being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings,', 'on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer,', 'entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting', 'by herself, with an air of such hurrying importance', 'as prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her', 'time only to form that idea, began directly to justify it,', 'by saying,', '\"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?\"', '\"No, ma\\'am.  What is it?\"', '\"Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all.--', \"When I got to Mr. Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite\", 'in a fuss about the child.  She was sure it was very', 'ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.', \"So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,'\", \"says I, 'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum--'\", 'and nurse said just the same.  But Charlotte, she would', 'not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily', 'he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he', 'stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child,', 'be said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world', 'but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy.  And so,', 'just as he was going away again, it came into my head,', 'I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it,', 'but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.', 'So upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,', 'and seemed to know something or other, and at last he', \"said in a whisper, 'For fear any unpleasant report\", 'should reach the young ladies under your care as to their', \"sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say,\", 'that I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope', 'Mrs. Dashwood will do very well.\\'\"', '\"What! is Fanny ill?\"', '\"That is exactly what I said, my dear.  \\'Lord!\\' says I,', \"'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the\", 'long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn,', 'seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young', 'man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it', 'turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing', 'in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged', \"above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There's for you,\", 'my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter,', 'except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?--', 'There is no great wonder in their liking one another;', 'but that matters should be brought so forward between them,', 'and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened', 'to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it', 'out directly.  Well, and so this was kept a great secret,', 'for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your', 'brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--', 'till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a', 'well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.', \"'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are all so fond\", \"of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;'\", 'and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all', 'alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to', 'come--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five', 'minutes before, that she thought to make a match between', \"Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who.\", 'So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity', 'and pride.  She fell into violent hysterics immediately,', \"with such screams as reached your brother's ears,\", 'as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs,', 'thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country.', 'So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place,', 'for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming', 'what was going on.  Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say,', 'I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded', 'like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit.', 'Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;', 'and your brother, he walked about the room, and said', 'he did not know what to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared', 'they should not stay a minute longer in the house,', 'and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too,', 'to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed', 'up their clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again,', 'and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,', 'and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar.', 'The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor', 'cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he', 'came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,', 'she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad.', 'I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,', 'with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.', 'Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he', 'hears of it!  To have his love used so scornfully! for', 'they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may.', 'I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest', 'passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I', 'had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is,', 'that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may', 'be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she', 'was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,', 'for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;', 'and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for', \"either of them.  I have no notion of people's making\", 'such a to-do about money and greatness.  There is no', 'reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry;', 'for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well', 'by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself,', 'she knows better than any body how to make the most', 'of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only', 'allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good', 'an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.', 'Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage', 'as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men;', 'and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my', 'Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them', 'exactly.\"', 'Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had', 'time enough to collect her thoughts, she was able', 'to give such an answer, and make such observations,', 'as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.', 'Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary', 'interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late', 'often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her', 'at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest,', 'in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able', 'to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to', 'give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality', 'on the conduct of every one concerned in it.', 'She could hardly determine what her own expectation', 'of its event really was; though she earnestly tried', 'to drive away the notion of its being possible to end', 'otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy.', 'What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could', 'not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear;', 'and still more anxious to know how Edward would', 'conduct himself.  For HIM she felt much compassion;--', 'for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure', 'that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.', 'As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject,', 'Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for', 'its discussion.  No time was to be lost in undeceiving her,', 'in making her acquainted with the real truth, and in', 'endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,', 'without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister,', 'or any resentment against Edward.', \"Elinor's office was a painful one.--She was going\", \"to remove what she really believed to be her sister's\", 'chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she', 'feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and', 'to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,', 'which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own', 'disappointment over again.  But unwelcome as such a task', 'must be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore', 'hastened to perform it.', 'She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own', 'feelings, or to represent herself as suffering much,', 'any otherwise than as the self-command she had practised', \"since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement, might\", 'suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.', 'Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could', 'not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied', 'by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged', 'rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror,', 'and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the comforter', 'of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs;', 'and all the comfort that could be given by assurances', 'of her own composure of mind, and a very earnest', 'vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence,', 'was readily offered.', 'But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.', 'Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging', 'as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely,', 'could she feel less than herself!  As for Lucy Steele,', 'she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely', 'incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could', 'not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards', 'to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her.', 'She would not even admit it to have been natural;', 'and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so,', 'by that which only could convince her, a better knowledge', 'of mankind.', 'Her first communication had reached no farther than', 'to state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time', \"it had existed.--Marianne's feelings had then broken in,\", 'and put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some', 'time all that could be done was to soothe her distress,', 'lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first', 'question on her side, which led to farther particulars,', 'was,', '\"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has', 'he written to you?\"', '\"I have known it these four months.  When Lucy', 'first came to Barton Park last November, she told me', 'in confidence of her engagement.\"', \"At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment\", 'which her lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder,', 'she exclaimed--', '\"Four months!--Have you known of this four months?\"', 'Elinor confirmed it.', '\"What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this', 'been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being', 'happy!\"--', '\"It was not fit that you should then know how much', 'I was the reverse!\"', '\"Four months!\"--cried Marianne again.--\"So calm!--', 'so cheerful!--how have you been supported?\"--', '\"By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to', 'Lucy, obliged me to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore,', 'to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my', 'family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me,', 'which it could not be in my power to satisfy.\"', 'Marianne seemed much struck.', '\"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my', 'mother,\" added Elinor; \"and once or twice I have attempted it;--', 'but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced', 'you.\"', '\"Four months!--and yet you loved him!\"--', '\"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort', 'of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing', 'how much I felt.  Now, I can think and speak of it with', 'little emotion.  I would not have you suffer on my account;', 'for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself.', 'I have many things to support me.  I am not conscious of having', 'provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own,', 'I have borne it as much as possible without spreading', 'it farther.  I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.', 'I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always', 'doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret,', 'in the end he must become so.

In short,', 'I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person', 'whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish', \"her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout\", 'the whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother,', 'in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has been dignified', 'and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear', 'it will be a bad one.\"', 'Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension;', \"and Elinor's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward,\", \"while braving his mother's threats, for a woman who could\", 'not reward him.', '\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did it end?\"', '\"I am sorry to say, ma\\'am, in a most unhappy rupture:--', \"Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother's notice.\", 'He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether', 'he is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can', 'make no inquiry.\"', '\"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"', '\"What, indeed, ma\\'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.', 'Born to the prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive', 'a situation more deplorable.

We must all feel for him;', 'and the more so, because it is totally out of our power', 'to assist him.\"', '\"Poor young man!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure', 'he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house;', 'and so I would tell him if I could see him.  It is not fit', 'that he should be living about at his own charge now,', 'at lodgings and taverns.\"', \"Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward,\", 'though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.', '\"If he would only have done as well by himself,\"', 'said John Dashwood, \"as all his friends were disposed to do', 'by him, he might now have been in his proper situation,', 'and would have wanted for nothing.  But as it is, it must', \"be out of anybody's power to assist him.  And there is one\", 'thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than', 'all--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind', 'of spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately,', \"which might have been Edward's, on proper conditions.\", 'I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over', 'the business.\"', '\"Well!\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"that is HER revenge.', \"Everybody has a way of their own.  But I don't think mine\", 'would be, to make one son independent, because another had', 'plagued me.\"', 'Marianne got up and walked about the room.', '\"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,\"', 'continued John, \"than to see his younger brother in', 'possession of an estate which might have been his own?', 'Poor Edward!

THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt', 'him to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation,', 'beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could', 'remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.', 'Elinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all', 'his offences in compassion for his punishment.  But though', 'confidence between them was, by this public discovery,', 'restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on', 'which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.', 'Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still', 'more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive', \"assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued\", 'affection for herself which she rather wished to do away;', \"and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying\", 'to converse upon a topic which always left her more', 'dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison', \"it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.\", 'She felt all the force of that comparison; but not', 'as her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now;', 'she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach,', 'regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted', 'herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,', 'without the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened', 'that she still fancied present exertion impossible,', 'and therefore it only dispirited her more.', 'Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards,', \"of affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings.\", 'But though so much of the matter was known to them already,', 'that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading', 'that knowledge farther, without seeking after more,', 'she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort', 'and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could;', 'and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual,', 'had prevented her going to them within that time.', 'The third day succeeding their knowledge of the', 'particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw', 'many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second', 'week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number;', 'but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again', 'in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them,', 'chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public', 'a place.', 'An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined', 'them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was', 'not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging', \"all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was herself left\", 'to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,', 'nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody', 'who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting', 'to her.  But at last she found herself with some surprise,', 'accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy,', 'expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving', 'encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings,', \"left her own party for a short time, to join their's.\", 'Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,', '\"Get it all out of her, my dear.

You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.\"', \"It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity\", \"and Elinor's too, that she would tell any thing WITHOUT\", 'being asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt.', '\"I am so glad to meet you;\" said Miss Steele,', 'taking her familiarly by the arm--\"for I wanted to see you', 'of all things in the world.\"  And then lowering her voice,', '\"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it.', 'Is she angry?\"', '\"Not at all, I believe, with you.\"', '\"That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?\"', '\"I cannot suppose it possible that she should.\"', '\"I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have', 'had such a time of it!

I do not care if it IS', \"the Doctor's favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part,\", 'I should never have known he DID like it better than', 'any other colour, if he had not happened to say so.', 'My cousins have been so plaguing me!

Whatever Lucy might think', 'about it herself, you know, it was no business of other', 'people to set it down for certain.\"', '\"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before,', 'I assure you,\" said Elinor.', '\"Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well,', 'and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks,', 'that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars', 'to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand', 'pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had', 'nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.', 'And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself,', 'that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars', 'would be off; and when Edward did not come near us', 'for three days, I could not tell what to think myself;', 'and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost;', \"for we came away from your brother's Wednesday,\", 'and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday,', 'and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.', 'Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits', 'rose against that.  However this morning he came just', 'as we came home from church; and then it all came out,', 'how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,', 'and been talked to by his mother and all of them,', 'and how he had declared before them all that he loved', 'nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have.', 'And how he had been so worried by what passed,', \"that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house,\", 'he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country,', 'some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn', 'all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better', 'of it.  And after thinking it all over and over again,', 'he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,', 'and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep', 'her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss,', 'for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope', 'of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders,', 'as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy,', 'and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear', 'to think of her doing no better, and so he begged,', 'if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the', 'matter directly, and leave him shift for himself.', 'I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.', 'And it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account,', 'that he said a word about being off, and not upon his own.', 'I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being', 'tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any', 'thing like it.  But, to be sure, Lucy would not give', 'ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly', '(with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,', \"and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things\", 'you know)--she told him directly, she had not the least', 'mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him', 'upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have,', 'she should be very glad to have it all, you know,', 'or something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy,', 'and talked on some time about what they should do,', 'and they agreed he should take orders directly,', 'and they must wait to be married till he got a living.', 'And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin', 'called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in', 'her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens;', 'so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them,', 'to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not', 'care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put', 'on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.\"', '\"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\"', 'said Elinor; \"you were all in the same room together,', 'were not you?\"', '\"No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you', 'think people make love when any body else is by?  Oh,', 'for shame!--To be sure you must know better than that.', '(Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in the', 'drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening', 'at the door.\"', '\"How!\" cried Elinor; \"have you been repeating to me', 'what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?', 'I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly', 'would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a', 'conversation which you ought not to have known yourself.', 'How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?\"', '\"Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stood at', 'the door, and heard what I could.  And I am sure Lucy would', 'have done just the same by me; for a year or two back,', 'when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together,', 'she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind', 'a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.\"', 'Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss', 'Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes,', 'from what was uppermost in her mind.', '\"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,\" said she;', '\"but now he is lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.

And for my part, I was all', 'in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the', 'huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,', 'nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine', 'out of sight.  Edward have got some business at Oxford,', 'he says; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT,', 'as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained.', 'I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!', \"(giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know what\", 'my cousins will say, when they hear of it.

Elinor was hardly', 'less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much', 'less bent on its being effected immediately, as that she', 'was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey,', 'which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge.', 'She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards', 'its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes', 'to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the', 'eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,', 'which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks', 'longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible', 'than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland', 'about the end of March, for the Easter holidays;', 'and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very', 'warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them.  This would', 'not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of', 'Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real', 'politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very', 'great amendment of his manners towards them since her', 'sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept', 'it with pleasure.', 'When she told Marianne what she had done, however,', 'her first reply was not very auspicious.', '\"Cleveland!\"--she cried, with great agitation.', '\"No, I cannot go to Cleveland.\"--', '\"You forget,\" said Elinor gently, \"that its situation', 'is not...that it is not in the neighbourhood of...\"', '\"But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go', 'into Somersetshire.--There, where I looked forward', 'to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there.\"', 'Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming', 'such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by', 'working on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure', 'which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother,', 'whom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible,', 'more comfortable manner, than any other plan could do,', 'and perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland,', 'which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to', \"Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey;\", \"and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend\", 'them down; and as there could be no occasion of their', 'staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at', \"home in little more than three weeks' time.  As Marianne's\", 'affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph', 'with little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.', 'Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest,', 'that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again', 'from Cleveland.  Elinor was grateful for the attention,', \"but it could not alter her design; and their mother's\", 'concurrence being readily gained, every thing relative', 'to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--', 'and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement', 'of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.', '\"Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall', 'do without the Miss Dashwoods;\"--was Mrs. Jennings\\'s', 'address to him when he first called on her, after their', 'leaving her was settled--\"for they are quite resolved', 'upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we', 'shall be, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape', 'at one another as dull as two cats.\"', 'Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous', 'sketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make', 'that offer, which might give himself an escape from it;--', 'and if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think', \"her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the window\", 'to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print,', 'which she was going to copy for her friend, he followed', 'her to it with a look of particular meaning, and conversed', 'with her there for several minutes.  The effect of his', 'discourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation,', 'for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even', 'changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear,', 'to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne', 'was playing, she could not keep herself from seeing', 'that Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation,', 'and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.--', 'Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval', \"of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another,\", \"some words of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear,\", 'in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness', 'of his house.  This set the matter beyond a doubt.', 'She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary', 'to do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.', 'What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish,', 'but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did', 'not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings', 'commended her in her heart for being so honest.', 'They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her', \"catching a syllable, when another lucky stop in Marianne's\", \"performance brought her these words in the Colonel's calm voice,--\", '\"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.\"', 'Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech,', 'she was almost ready to cry out, \"Lord! what should', 'hinder it?\"--but checking her desire, confined herself', 'to this silent ejaculation.', '\"This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.\"', \"This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not\", 'seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least,', 'for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards,', 'and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard', 'Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,', '\"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.\"', 'Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude,', 'and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence,', 'the Colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he', 'immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away', 'without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old', 'friend could have made so indifferent a suitor.', 'What had really passed between them was to this effect.', '\"I have heard,\" said he, with great compassion,', '\"of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered', 'from his family; for if I understand the matter right,', 'he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering', 'in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.--', 'Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?--\"', 'Elinor told him that it was.', '\"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied,', 'with great feeling,--\"of dividing, or attempting to divide,', 'two young people long attached to each other, is terrible.--', 'Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing--what', 'she may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr. Ferrars two', 'or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased', 'with him.  He is not a young man with whom one can', 'be intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have', 'seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake,', 'and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.', 'I understand that he intends to take orders.  Will you', 'be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford,', \"now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post,\", 'is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,', 'perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now,', 'it may be  nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it', 'were more  valuable.-- It is a rectory, but a small one;', 'the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than', '200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable', 'of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as', 'to afford him a very comfortable income.  Such as it is,', 'however, my pleasure in presenting him to it,', 'will be very great.  Pray assure him of it.\"', \"Elinor's astonishment at this commission could\", 'hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really', 'making her an offer of his hand.  The preferment,', 'which only two days before she had considered as hopeless', 'for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--', 'and SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to', 'bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had', 'attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor', 'feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share', 'in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,', 'and her gratitude for the particular friendship,', 'which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act,', 'were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.  She thanked him', \"for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and\", 'disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve;', 'and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure,', 'if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office', 'to another.  But at the same time, she could not help', 'thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself.', 'It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give', 'Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER,', 'she would have been very glad to be spared herself;--', 'but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy,', 'declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being', 'given through her means, that she would not on any account', 'make farther opposition.  Edward, she believed, was still in', 'town,', 'and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele.', 'She could undertake therefore to inform him of it,', 'in the course of the day.  After this had been settled,', 'Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage', 'in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour,', 'and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the', 'house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor,', 'as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very light of,', 'at least as far as regarded its size.', '\"The smallness of the house,\" said she,', '\"I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them,', 'for it will be in proportion to their family and income.\"', 'By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE', \"was considering Mr. Ferrars's marriage as the certain\", 'consequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it', 'possible that Delaford living could supply such an income,', 'as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on--', 'and he said so.', '\"This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars', 'comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.', 'I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this;', 'and my interest is hardly more extensive.  If, however,', 'by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve', 'him farther, I must think very differently of him', 'from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful', 'to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present.', 'What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,', 'since it can advance him so little towards what must', 'be his principal, his only object of happiness.', 'His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least,', 'I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--\"', 'Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood,', 'so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings;', 'but after this narration of what really passed between', 'Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at the window,', 'the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may', 'perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,', 'nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from', 'an offer of marriage.', 'CHAPTER 40', '\"Well, Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Jennings,', 'sagaciously smiling, as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn,', '\"I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you;', 'for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of hearing,', 'I could not help catching enough to understand his business.', 'And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,', 'and I wish you joy of it with all my heart.\"', '\"Thank you, ma\\'am,\" said Elinor.  \"It is a matter', 'of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel', 'Brandon most sensibly.

And as to the house', 'being a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel would be at,', 'for it is as good a one as ever I saw.\"', '\"He spoke of its being out of repair.\"', '\"Well, and whose fault is that? why don\\'t he repair it?--', 'who should do it but himself?\"', \"They were interrupted by the servant's coming in to\", 'announce the carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings', 'immediately preparing to go, said,--', '\"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half', 'my talk out.

Mr. Ferrars is to be', 'the man.  Well, so much the better for him.  Ay, to be sure,', 'he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad', 'to find things are so forward between you.  But, my dear,', 'is not this rather out of character?  Should not the Colonel', 'write himself?--sure, he is the proper person.\"', 'Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of', \"Mrs. Jennings's speech, neither did she think it worth\", 'inquiring into; and therefore only replied to its conclusion.', '\"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather', 'wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars', 'than himself.\"', '\"And so YOU are forced to do it.

Her astonishment and confusion', 'were very great on his so sudden appearance.  She had', 'not seen him before since his engagement became public,', 'and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted', 'with it; which, with the consciousness of what she', 'had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him,', 'made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.', 'He too was much distressed; and they sat down together', 'in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he', 'had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming', 'into the room, he could not recollect; but determining', 'to be on the safe side, he made his apology in form', 'as soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair.', '\"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished', 'to speak with me, at least I understood her so--or I', 'certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner;', 'though at the same time, I should have been extremely', 'sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;', 'especially as it will most likely be some time--it', 'is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure', 'of meeting you again.

Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined\", \"from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious\", \"than Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report,\", \"and confirming Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the\", 'necessity of her immediate removal with her infant;', 'and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle,', 'found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great', 'to be withstood.

Mrs. Jennings, however, with a', 'kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,', 'declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland', 'as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,', 'by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place', 'of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her', 'on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,', 'desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her', 'better experience in nursing, of material use.', 'Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature', 'of her malady, and feeling herself universally ill,', 'could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered;', 'and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced,', 'but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe;', 'for on that day they were to have begun their journey home;', 'and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings,', 'were to have taken their mother by surprise on the', 'following forenoon.  The little she said was all in', 'lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried', 'to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN', 'really believed herself, that it would be a very short one.', 'The next day produced little or no alteration in the', 'state of the patient; she certainly was not better, and,', 'except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse.', 'Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer,', 'though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity', 'and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be', 'frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last', 'by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her;', 'and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself,', 'with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going', 'likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings', 'interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away', \"while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's\", 'account, would be to deprive them both, she thought,', 'of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once', 'that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself,', 'that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening,', 'while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &c. she', 'urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying', 'the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not', \"long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's\", 'entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed', 'to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person', 'so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.', 'Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all', 'these arrangements.  She knew not that she had been', 'the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away,', 'in about seven days from the time of their arrival.', 'It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing', 'of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern,', 'she never mentioned her name.', \"Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure,\", 'and her situation continued, with little variation,', 'the same.  Mr. Harris, who attended her every day,', 'still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood', 'was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others', 'was by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined', 'very early in the seizure that Marianne would never', 'get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly', \"of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's forebodings,\", 'was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.', 'He tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different', 'judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd;', 'but the many hours of each day in which he was left', 'entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission', 'of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from', 'his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.', 'On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy', 'anticipations of both were almost done away; for when', 'Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better.', 'Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable', 'than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed in every', 'pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that', 'in her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own', \"judgment rather than her friend's, in making very light\", 'of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland;', 'and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be', 'able to travel.', 'But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.--', 'Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing', 'more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before.', 'Her sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to', 'attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue', 'of having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully', 'administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with', 'satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which', 'she expected the most beneficial effects.  Her sleep,', 'though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it,', 'lasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe', 'the result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her', 'during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing', 'of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed;', 'her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating', \"herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained\", 'alone with Marianne.', 'The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed;', 'and her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention', 'her continual change of posture, and heard the frequent', 'but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips,', 'was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber,', 'when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise', 'in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness,', 'cried out,--', '\"Is mama coming?--\"', '\"Not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror,', 'and assisting Marianne to lie down again, \"but she will', 'be here, I hope, before it is long.  It is a great way,', 'you know, from hence to Barton.\"', '\"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne,', 'in the same hurried manner.  \"I shall never see her,', 'if she goes by London.\"', 'Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not', 'quite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her,', 'eagerly felt her pulse.  It was lower and quicker than ever!', 'and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm', 'increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending', 'instantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger', 'to Barton for her mother.  To consult with Colonel Brandon', 'on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought', 'which immediately followed the resolution of its performance;', 'and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place', 'by her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room,', 'where she knew he was generally to be found at a much', 'later hour than the present.', 'It was no time for hesitation.  Her fears and her', 'difficulties were immediately before him.  Her fears,', 'he had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--', 'he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her', 'difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness', 'that seemed to speak the occasion, and the service', 'pre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the', 'messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.  Elinor made no', 'resistance that was not easily overcome.  She thanked him', 'with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went', 'to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and', 'an order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines', 'to her mother.', 'The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel', 'Brandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully', 'was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,', 'whose attendance must relieve, and whose friendship might', 'soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD', 'be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,', 'would lessen it.', 'HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all', 'the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary', 'arrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated', 'with exactness the time in which she might look for', 'his return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.', 'The horses arrived, even before they were expected,', 'and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look', 'of solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear,', 'hurried into the carriage.  It was then about twelve', \"o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait\", 'for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her', 'the rest of the night.  It was a night of almost equal', 'suffering to both.  Hour after hour passed away in sleepless', \"pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most\", \"cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared.\", 'Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all', 'her former security; and the servant who sat up with her,', 'for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called,', 'only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress', 'had always thought.', \"Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals,\", 'fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she', 'mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of', 'poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled', 'with so many days of illness, and wretched for some', 'immediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon', 'be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long,', 'and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving', 'too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.', 'She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris,', 'or if HE could not come, for some other advice,', \"when the former--but not till after five o'clock--arrived.\", 'His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay,', 'for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant', 'alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger', 'to be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh', 'mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which,', 'in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor.  He promised', 'to call again in the course of three or four hours,', 'and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more', 'composed than he had found them.', 'With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not', 'being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the', 'morning of what had passed.  Her former apprehensions,', 'now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of', 'the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,', \"her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her\", 'to offer the comfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.', 'The rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young,', 'so lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested', \"person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings's compassion\", 'she had other claims.  She had been for three months', 'her companion, was still under her care, and she was', 'known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy.', 'The distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite,', 'was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings', 'considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what', 'Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings', 'was very sincere.', 'Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--', 'but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the', 'last would produce.  His medicines had failed;--the fever', 'was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet--not more', 'herself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching all,', 'and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call', 'in further advice.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had', 'still something more to try, some more fresh application,', 'of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his', 'visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached', 'the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood.', 'She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;', 'but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued', \"till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed,\", 'her thoughts wandering from one image of grief,', 'one suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed', 'to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,', 'who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger', 'of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition', \"which Marianne's disappointment had brought on.\", 'Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it', 'gave fresh misery to her reflections.', 'About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a', 'dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent,', 'even to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive', \"a slight amendment in her sister's pulse;--she waited,\", 'watched, and examined it again and again;--and at last,', 'with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness,', 'than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate', 'her hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,', 'to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her', 'young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--', 'and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust,', 'told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was too late.', 'Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter,', 'she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.', 'Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom', 'yet blessed her.  Others even arose to confirm it.', 'Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor', 'with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on', 'her with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and', 'hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no', 'moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at', \"four o'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on\", 'a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation,', 'gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.', 'Marianne was in every respect materially better,', 'and he declared her entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings,', 'perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her', 'forebodings which had been found in their late alarm,', 'allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,', 'with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness,', 'the probability of an entire recovery.', 'Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a', 'different kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety.', 'Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her', 'doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations', 'of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--', 'but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,', \"no smiles.  All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction,\", 'silent and strong.', 'She continued by the side of her sister, with little', 'intermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear,', 'satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits,', 'supplying every succour, and watching almost every look and', 'every breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,', 'in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--', 'but when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination,', 'that every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne', \"at six o'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all\", 'appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.', 'The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon', \"might be expected back.  At ten o'clock, she trusted,\", 'or at least not much later her mother would be relieved', 'from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be', 'travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely', 'less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress', 'of time which yet kept them in ignorance!', \"At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep,\", 'she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.', 'Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of', 'dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--', 'and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings', 'of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.', 'Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion,', \"to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to\", 'take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue,', 'no capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was', 'not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant.', 'Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the', 'sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,', 'left her there again to her charge and her thoughts,', 'and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.', 'The night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared', 'round the house, and the rain beat against the windows;', 'but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.', 'Marianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--', 'they had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience.', 'The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten,', 'Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment', 'she heard a carriage driving up to the house;', 'and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite', 'of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,', 'that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and', 'opened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth.', 'She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her.', 'The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.', 'By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it', 'to be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the', \"excess of her poor mother's alarm, gave some explanation\", 'to such unexpected rapidity.', 'Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult', 'to be calm, as at that moment.  The knowledge of what her', 'mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--', 'of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and', 'of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was', 'impossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done', 'was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till', \"she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with her sister,\", 'she hurried down stairs.', 'The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along', 'an inner lobby, assured her that they were already', 'in the house.  She rushed to the drawing-room,--she', 'entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.', 'CHAPTER 44', 'Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at', 'the sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart', 'in turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand', 'was already on the lock, when its action was suspended', 'by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather', 'of command than supplication,', '\"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--', 'I entreat you to stay.\"', '\"No, sir,\" she replied with firmness, \"I shall NOT stay.', 'Your business cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose,', 'forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"', '\"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence,', '\"that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil,', 'it would not have turned me from the door.  My business', 'is with you, and only you.\"', '\"With me!\"--in the utmost amazement--\"well, sir,--', 'be quick--and if you can--less violent.\"', '\"Sit down, and I will be both.\"', 'She hesitated; she knew not what to do.  The possibility', \"of Colonel Brandon's arriving and finding her there,\", 'came across her.  But she had promised to hear him,', 'and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged.', \"After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that\", 'prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would', 'best promote it, she walked silently towards the table,', 'and sat down.  He took the opposite chair, and for half', 'a minute not a word was said by either.', '\"Pray be quick, sir,\"--said Elinor, impatiently;--', '\"I have no time to spare.\"', 'He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation,', 'and seemed not to hear her.', '\"Your sister,\" said he, with abruptness, a moment', 'afterwards--\"is out of danger.  I heard it from the servant.', 'God be praised!--But is it true? is it really true?\"', 'Elinor would not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with', 'yet greater eagerness.', '\"For God\\'s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?\"', '\"We hope she is.\"', 'He rose up, and walked across the room.', '\"Had I known as much half an hour ago--But', 'since I AM here,\"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he', 'returned to his seat--\"what does it signify?--For once,', 'Miss Dashwood--it will be the last time, perhaps--let us', 'be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.--', 'Tell me honestly\"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--', '\"do you think me most a knave or a fool?\"', 'Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.', 'She began to think that be must be in liquor;--the', 'strangeness of such a visit, and of such manners,', 'seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression', 'she immediately rose, saying,', '\"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return', 'to Combe--I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.--', 'Whatever your business may be with me, will it be better', 'recollected and explained to-morrow.\"', '\"I understand you,\" he replied, with an expressive smile,', 'and a voice perfectly calm; \"yes, I am very drunk.--', 'A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was', 'enough to over-set me.\"', '\"At Marlborough!\"--cried Elinor, more and more at', 'a loss to understand what he would be at.', '\"Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o\\'clock,', 'and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise', 'since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough.\"', 'The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence', 'of his eye as he spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever', 'other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland,', 'he was not brought there by intoxication, she said,', \"after a moment's recollection,\", '\"Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly', 'DO--that after what has passed--your coming here in', 'this manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice,', 'requires a very particular excuse.--What is it,', 'that you mean by it?\"--', '\"I mean,\"--said he, with serious energy--\"if I can,', 'to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW.', 'I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind', 'of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you,', 'and by convincing you, that though I have been always', 'a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain', 'something like forgiveness from Ma--from your sister.\"', '\"Is this the real reason of your coming?\"', '\"Upon my soul it is,\"--was his answer, with a warmth', 'which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance,', 'and in spite of herself made her think him sincere.', '\"If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--', 'for Marianne DOES--she has LONG forgiven you.\"', '\"Has she?\"--he cried, in the same eager tone.--', '\"Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it.', 'But she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable', 'grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?\"', 'Elinor bowed her assent.', '\"I do not know,\" said he, after a pause of expectation', 'on her side, and thoughtfulness on his own,--\"how YOU', 'may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister,', 'or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.--', 'Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is', 'worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.', 'When I first became intimate in your family, I had no', 'other intention, no other view in the acquaintance', 'than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain', 'in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.', \"Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners\", 'could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost', 'from the first, was of a kind--It is astonishing,', 'when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE was, that my', 'heart should have been so insensible!  But at first', 'I must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.', 'Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement,', 'giving way to feelings which I had always been too much', 'in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means', 'in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any', 'design of returning her affection.\"', 'Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him', 'with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,', '\"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby,', 'for you to relate, or for me to listen any longer.', 'Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.--', 'Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on', 'the subject.\"', '\"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied,', '\"My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive,', 'always in the habit of associating with people of better', 'income than myself.  Every year since my coming of age,', 'or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though', 'the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free;', 'yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant,', 'it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my', 'circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune.  To attach', 'myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be', 'thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty--', 'which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,', 'Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting', 'in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a', 'thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said', 'for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity,', 'I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated,', 'because I did not THEN know what it was to love.', 'But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted; for, had I', 'really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity,', 'to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?--', 'But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,', 'which her affection and her society would have deprived', 'of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,', 'lost every thing that could make it a blessing.\"', '\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened,', '\"believe yourself at one time attached to her?\"', '\"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood', 'such tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have', 'done it?--Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees,', 'sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life', 'were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions', 'were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.', 'Even THEN, however, when fully determined on paying', 'my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly', 'to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,', 'from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement', 'while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.', 'I will not reason here--nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate', 'on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling', 'to engage my faith where my honour was already bound.', 'The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,', 'providing with great circumspection for a possible', 'opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched', 'for ever.  At last, however, my resolution was taken,', 'and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,', 'to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her,', 'and openly assure her of an affection which I had already', 'taken such pains to display.  But in the interim--in the', 'interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I', 'could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private--', 'a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin', 'all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery', 'took place,\"--here he hesitated and looked down.--\"Mrs. Smith', 'had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some', 'distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of', 'her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not', 'explain myself farther,\" he added, looking at her with an', 'heightened colour and an enquiring eye--\"your particular', 'intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago.\"', '\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise,', 'and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him,', '\"I have heard it all.  And how you will explain away any', 'part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess', 'is beyond my comprehension.\"', '\"Remember,\" cried Willoughby, \"from whom you received', 'the account.  Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge', 'that her situation and her character ought to have been', 'respected by me.  I do not mean to justify myself, but at', 'the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing', 'to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,', 'and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.', 'If the violence of her passions, the weakness of her', 'understanding--I do not mean, however, to defend myself.', 'Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often,', 'with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which,', 'for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.', 'I wish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured', 'more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection', 'for me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers;', 'and whose mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!\"--', '\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate', 'girl--I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion', 'of such a subject may well be--your indifference is no', 'apology for your cruel neglect of her.  Do not think yourself', 'excused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding', 'on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.', 'You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself', 'in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay,', 'always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence.\"', '\"But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,\" he warmly', 'replied; \"I did not recollect that I had omitted to give', 'her my direction; and common sense might have told her', 'how to find it out.\"', '\"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\"', '\"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion', 'may be guessed.  The purity of her life, the formality', 'of her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing', 'was against me.  The matter itself I could not deny,', 'and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was', 'previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my', 'conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with', 'the very little attention, the very little portion of my', 'time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit.', 'In short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I', 'might have saved myself.  In the height of her morality,', 'good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would', 'marry Eliza.  That could not be--and I was formally', 'dismissed from her favour and her house.  The night', 'following this affair--I was to go the next morning--', 'was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct', 'should be.  The struggle was great--but it ended too soon.', 'My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her', 'attachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh', 'that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false', 'ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally', 'inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased.', 'I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife,', 'if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think', 'that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do.', 'A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave', 'Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day;', 'some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking', 'this engagement.  But whether I should write this apology,', 'or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate.', 'To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted', 'whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution.', 'In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,', 'as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw', 'her miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping', 'never to see her again.\"', '\"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\" said Elinor,', 'reproachfully; \"a note would have answered every purpose.--', 'Why was it necessary to call?\"', '\"It was necessary to my own pride.  I could not bear', 'to leave the country in a manner that might lead you,', 'or the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part', 'of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself--', 'and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage,', 'in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister,', 'however, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter,', 'I found her alone.  You were all gone I do not know where.', 'I had left her only the evening before, so fully,', 'so firmly resolved within my self on doing right!', 'A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever;', 'and I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I', 'walked from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself,', 'delighted with every body!  But in this, our last interview', 'of friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt', 'that almost took from me the power of dissembling.', 'Her sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told', 'her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I', 'never shall forget it--united too with such reliance,', 'such confidence in me!--Oh, God!--what a hard-hearted', 'rascal I was!\"', 'They were both silent for a few moments.', 'Elinor first spoke.', '\"Did you tell her that you should soon return?\"', '\"I do not know what I told her,\" he replied, impatiently;', '\"less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all', 'likelihood much more than was justified by the future.', \"I cannot think of it.--It won't do.--Then came your dear mother\", 'to torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence.', 'Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I was miserable.', 'Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it', 'gives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge', 'to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart,', 'that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and', 'exultation to me now.  Well, I went, left all that I loved,', 'and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent.', 'My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,', 'and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my', 'own reflections so cheerful--when I looked forward', 'every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton,', 'the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed journey!\"', 'He stopped.', '\"Well, sir,\" said Elinor, who, though pitying him,', 'grew impatient for his departure, \"and this is all?\"', '\"Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?--', 'That infamous letter--Did she shew it you?\"', '\"Yes, I saw every note that passed.\"', '\"When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did,', 'for I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is--', 'in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more', 'simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--', 'my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word', 'was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer,', 'were she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart.', 'To know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--', 'a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof', 'would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe', 'they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure', 'they are dearer.\"', \"Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes\", 'in the course of this extraordinary conversation,', 'was now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check', 'such ideas in her companion as the last.', '\"This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that', 'you are married.  Relate only what in your conscience', 'you think necessary for me to hear.\"', '\"Marianne\\'s note, by assuring me that I was still', 'as dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many,', 'many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant', 'in her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy', 'of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say awakened,', 'because time and London, business and dissipation,', 'had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing', 'a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her,', 'and chusing to fancy that she too must have become', 'indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment', 'as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders', 'in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,', 'overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then,', \"'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.'--\", 'But this note made me know myself better.  I felt that', 'she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman', 'in the world, and that I was using her infamously.', 'But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey', 'and me.  To retreat was impossible.  All that I had to do,', 'was to avoid you both.  I sent no answer to Marianne,', 'intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice;', 'and for some time I was even determined not to call in', 'Berkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect', 'the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else,', 'I watched you all safely out of the house one morning,', 'and left my name.\"', '\"Watched us out of the house!\"', '\"Even so.  You would be surprised to hear how often', 'I watched you, how often I was on the point of falling', 'in with you.  I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight,', 'as the carriage drove by.

I avoided the Middletons as much as possible,', 'as well as everybody else who was likely to prove', 'an acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being', 'in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe,', 'the first day of his coming, and the day after I had called', \"at Mrs. Jennings's.  He asked me to a party, a dance at his\", 'house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement', 'that you and your sister were to be there, I should have', 'felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.', 'The next morning brought another short note from Marianne--', 'still affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything', 'that could make MY conduct most hateful.  I could not', 'answer it.  I tried--but could not frame a sentence.', 'But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.', 'If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it', 'was THEN.  With my head and heart full of your sister,', 'I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those', 'three or four weeks were worse than all.

It was a horrid', 'sight!--yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying,', 'it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew', 'exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last', 'in this world.  She was before me, constantly before me,', 'as I travelled, in the same look and hue.\"', 'A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.', 'Willoughby first rousing himself, broke it thus:', '\"Well, let me make haste and be gone.

Your sister', 'wrote to me again, you know, the very next morning.', 'You saw what she said.  I was breakfasting at the', 'Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought', 'to me there from my lodgings.

Some vague report had', 'reached her before of my attachment to some young lady', 'in Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation', 'the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was,', 'and made her more jealous than ever.  Affecting that air', 'of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman', 'one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read', 'its contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.', 'She read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness I could', 'have borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it', 'must be appeased.  And, in short--what do you think of my', \"wife's style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--\", 'truly feminine--was it not?\"', '\"Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing.\"', '\"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying', 'such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to.', 'The original was all her own--her own happy thoughts', 'and gentle diction.  But what could I do!--we were engaged,', 'every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am', 'talking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words,', 'her money was necessary to me, and in a situation like', 'mine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture.', 'And after all, what did it signify to my character', 'in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language', 'my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.', 'My business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether', 'I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.--', \"'I am ruined for ever in their opinion--' said I to\", \"myself--'I am shut out for ever from their society,\", 'they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter', \"will only make them think me a blackguard one.' Such were\", 'my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness,', \"I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics\", 'of Marianne.  Her three notes--unluckily they were all', 'in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence,', 'and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up,', 'and could not even kiss them.  And the lock of hair--that too', 'I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book,', 'which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating', 'virulence,--the dear lock--all, every memento was torn from me.\"', '\"You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,\"', 'said Elinor, while her voice, in spite of herself,', 'betrayed her compassionate emotion; \"you ought not to speak', 'in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister.', 'You had made your own choice.  It was not forced on you.', 'Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect,', 'at least.  She must be attached to you, or she would not', 'have married you.  To treat her with unkindness, to speak', 'of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne--nor can I', 'suppose it a relief to your own conscience.\"', '\"Do not talk to me of my wife,\" said he with a heavy sigh.--', '\"She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no', 'regard for her when we married.--Well, married we were,', 'and came down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards', 'returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me,', 'Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?--', 'Am I--be it only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion', 'than I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong.', 'Have I explained away any part of my guilt?\"', '\"Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little.--', 'You have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than', 'I had believed you.

You tell me that', 'she has forgiven me already.

Now, however, his good-natured, honest,', 'stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern', 'for your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling', 'me what he knew ought to--though probably he did not', 'think it WOULD--vex me horridly.  As bluntly as he could', 'speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood', 'was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter that', 'morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger', 'most imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright,', '&c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself', 'off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John.', 'His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much', 'of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted,', 'he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an', 'old promise about a pointer puppy.  What I felt on hearing', 'that your sister was dying--and dying too, believing me', 'the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me', 'in her latest moments--for how could I tell what horrid', 'projects might not have been imputed?

Her thoughts were silently fixed', 'on the irreparable injury which too early an independence', 'and its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury,', 'had made in the mind, the character, the happiness,', 'of a man who, to every advantage of person and talents,', 'united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a', 'feeling, affectionate temper.  The world had made him', 'extravagant and vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him', 'cold-hearted and selfish.  Vanity, while seeking its own', 'guilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved', 'him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least', 'its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.', 'Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led', 'him likewise to punishment.  The attachment, from which', 'against honour, against feeling, against every better interest', 'he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no longer allowable,', 'governed every thought; and the connection, for the sake', 'of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister', 'to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness', 'to himself of a far more incurable nature.  From a reverie', 'of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes', 'by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie at least', 'equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said--', '\"There is no use in staying here; I must be off.\"', '\"Are you going back to town?\"', '\"No--to Combe Magna.  I have business there;', 'from thence to town in a day or two.  Good bye.\"', 'He held out his hand.  She could not refuse to give', \"him hers's;--he pressed it with affection.\", '\"And you DO think something better of me than', 'you did?\"--said he, letting it fall, and leaning against', 'the mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go.', 'Elinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave,', 'pitied, wished him well--was even interested in his', 'happiness--and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour', 'most likely to promote it.  His answer was not very encouraging.', '\"As to that,\" said he, \"I must rub through the world', 'as well as I can.  Domestic happiness is out of the question.', 'If, however, I am allowed to think that you and yours feel', 'an interest in my fate and actions, it may be the means--it', 'may put me on my guard--at least, it may be something to', 'live for.  Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.', 'Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--\"', 'Elinor stopped him with a reproof.', '\"Well,\"--he replied--\"once more good bye.

And if', 'that some one should be the very he whom, of all others,', 'I could least bear--but I will not stay to rob myself', 'of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing', 'that where I have most injured I can least forgive.', 'Good bye,--God bless you!\"', 'And with these words, he almost ran out of the room.', 'CHAPTER 45', 'Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time', 'even after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained', 'too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in', 'themselves, but of which sadness was the general result,', 'to think even of her sister.', 'Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had', 'abhorred as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite', 'of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration', 'for the sufferings produced by them, which made her', 'think of him as now separated for ever from her family,', 'with a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she', 'soon acknowledged within herself--to his wishes than to', 'his merits.  She felt that his influence over her mind', 'was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason', 'to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,', 'that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it', 'was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love', 'for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.', 'But she felt that it was so, long, long before she could', 'feel his influence less.', 'When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne,', 'she found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet', \"a sleep to the extent of her hopes.  Elinor's heart was full.\", \"The past, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit,\", \"Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected arrival,\", 'threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits', 'which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made', 'her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister.', 'Short was the time, however, in which that fear could', \"affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's\", 'leaving the house, she was again called down stairs', 'by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her', \"mother from every unnecessary moment's horrible suspense,\", 'she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward', 'door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it.', 'Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the', \"house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's\", 'being no more, had no voice to inquire after her,', 'no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither for', 'salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--', 'and her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth,', 'was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she', 'had been before by her fears.  She was supported into', 'the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;--', 'and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable', 'to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her', \"at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look\", 'which spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction', 'of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment.', 'He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her own.', 'As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself,', 'to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she', 'was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever', \"by absence, unhappiness, and danger.  Elinor's delight,\", 'as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked', 'by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;--', 'but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent,', 'when the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne,', 'satisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious', 'of being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the', 'silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her.', 'Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor,', \"in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed.\", 'But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless,', 'and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to', 'make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits.', 'Willoughby, \"poor Willoughby,\" as she now allowed', 'herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she', 'would not but have heard his vindication for the world,', 'and now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him', 'so harshly before.  But her promise of relating it to her', 'sister was invariably painful.  She dreaded the performance', 'of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be;', 'doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever', 'be happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby', 'a widower.  Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself,', 'felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more', \"than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was due,\", \"and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby's death.\", \"The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been\", 'much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm;', 'for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she', 'had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that', 'very day, without waiting for any further intelligence,', 'and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,', 'that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch', 'Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her', 'where there might be infection.', 'Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant', \"cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved\", 'her to be, as she repeatedly declared herself, one of', 'the happiest women in the world.  Elinor could not hear', 'the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes', 'wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.', 'But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account', 'of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her,', 'was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only', 'of what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to her', 'from a danger in which, as she now began to feel,', 'her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate', 'attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;--', 'and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy', 'unthought of by Elinor.

I, you may', 'well believe, could talk of nothing but my child;--he could', 'not conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own,', 'and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world', 'now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,', 'not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible', 'feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant,', 'affection for Marianne.  He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since', 'the first moment of seeing her.\"', 'Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language,', 'not the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural', \"embellishments of her mother's active fancy, which fashioned\", 'every thing delightful to her as it chose.', '\"His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything', 'that Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm,', 'as more sincere or constant--which ever we are to call it--', \"has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne's\", 'unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and', 'without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could', 'he have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--', 'such openness, such sincerity!--no one can be deceived', 'in HIM.\"', '\"Colonel Brandon\\'s character,\" said Elinor,', '\"as an excellent man, is well established.\"', '\"I know it is\"--replied her mother seriously, \"or', 'after such a warning, I should be the last to encourage', 'such affection, or even to be pleased by it.  But his coming', 'for me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship,', 'is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.\"', '\"His character, however,\" answered Elinor, \"does not rest', 'on ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne,', 'were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.', 'To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long', 'and intimately known; they equally love and respect him;', 'and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired,', 'is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him,', 'that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready', 'as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing', 'to us in the world.  What answer did you give him?--Did you', 'allow him to hope?\"', '\"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him', 'or to myself.  Marianne might at that moment be dying.', 'But he did not ask for hope or encouragement.  His was', 'an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion', 'to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.', 'Yet after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite', 'overcome--that if she lived, as I trusted she might,', 'my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage;', 'and since our arrival, since our delightful security,', 'I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every', 'encouragement in my power.  Time, a very little time,', \"I tell him, will do everything;--Marianne's heart is\", 'not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.--', 'His own merits must soon secure it.\"', '\"To judge from the Colonel\\'s spirits, however,', 'you have not yet made him equally sanguine.\"', '\"No.--He thinks Marianne\\'s affection too deeply', 'rooted for any change in it under a great length of time,', 'and even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident', 'of himself to believe, that with such a difference of age', 'and disposition he could ever attach her.  There, however,', 'he is quite mistaken.  His age is only so much beyond', 'hers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and', 'principles fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced,', 'is exactly the very one to make your sister happy.', 'And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour.', 'My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not', 'so handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time,', 'there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.--', \"There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby's\", 'eyes at times, which I did not like.\"', 'Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother,', 'without waiting for her assent, continued,', '\"And his manners, the Colonel\\'s manners are not only', \"more pleasing to me than Willoughby's ever were, but they\", 'are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching', 'to Marianne.  Their gentleness, their genuine attention', 'to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity', 'is much more accordant with her real disposition, than', 'the liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed', 'of the other.  I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby', 'turned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself', 'the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy', 'with HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon.\"', 'She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree', 'with her, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore', 'gave no offence.', '\"At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,\"', 'added Mrs. Dashwood, \"even if I remain at Barton; and in all', 'probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there', 'certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by,', 'that would suit us quite as well as our present situation.\"', 'Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting', 'her to Delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn.', '\"His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know,', 'everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know', 'nor desire to know, what it really is, I am sure it must be', 'a good one.\"', 'Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a', 'third person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over', 'in private, to wish success to her friend, and yet', 'in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.', 'CHAPTER 46', \"Marianne's illness, though weakening in its kind,\", 'had not been long enough to make her recovery slow;', \"and with youth, natural strength, and her mother's presence\", 'in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove,', 'within four days after the arrival of the latter,', \"into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room.  When there, at her own\", 'particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth', 'her thanks to him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon', 'was invited to visit her.', 'His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered', 'looks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately', \"held out to him, was such, as, in Elinor's conjecture,\", 'must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne,', 'or the consciousness of its being known to others;', 'and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying', 'complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable', 'recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind,', 'brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza', 'already acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye,', 'the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,', 'and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.', 'Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than', 'her daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced,', 'and therefore watching to very different effect,', \"saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what arose\", 'from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in', 'the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself', 'to think that something more than gratitude already dawned.', 'At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing', 'visibly stronger every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood,', \"urged equally by her own and her daughter's wishes,\", 'began to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER measures', 'depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could', \"not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel\", 'Brandon was soon brought, by their united request,', 'to consider his own abode there as equally determinate,', \"if not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs. Jennings's\", 'united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed', 'on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back,', 'for the better accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel,', 'at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings,', 'whose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable', 'for other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure', 'to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the course', 'of a few weeks.', 'The day of separation and departure arrived;', 'and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened', 'a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full', 'of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart', 'from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding', 'Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend,', 'was carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he', 'seemed anxious that she should engross at least half.', 'Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, and the others', 'were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers,', 'and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned', 'to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid', 'for the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon', 'immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.', 'The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne', 'bore her journey on both, without essential fatigue.', 'Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most', 'solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,', 'was the office of each watchful companion, and each', 'found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness', 'of spirits.  To Elinor, the observation of the latter', 'was particularly grateful.  She, who had seen her week', 'after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish', 'of heart which she had neither courage to speak of,', 'nor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other', 'could equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which,', 'in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection,', 'must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.', 'As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered', 'on scenes of which every field and every tree brought', 'some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent', 'and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice,', 'sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here,', 'Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw,', 'as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she', 'had been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural', 'in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,', 'and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the', 'whole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction', 'of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner', 'had they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne', 'turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness,', 'as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight', 'of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could', 'be connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed', 'at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her,', 'it never passed away without the atonement of a smile.', 'After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it;', 'but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera,', 'procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their', 'favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name', 'in his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head,', 'put the music aside, and after running over the keys', 'for a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers,', 'and closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmness', 'as she did so, that she should in future practice much.', 'The next morning produced no abatement in these', 'happy symptoms.  On the contrary, with a mind and body', 'alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with', 'more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of', \"Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party\", 'which would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits', 'and cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.', '\"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered', 'my strength,\" said she, \"we will take long walks together', 'every day.  We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down,', \"and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John's\", 'new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;', 'and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory,', 'and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told', 'they once reached.  I know we shall be happy.  I know', 'the summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to be', 'later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner', 'I shall divide every moment between music and reading.', 'I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course', 'of serious study.  Our own library is too well known to me,', 'to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement.', 'But there are many works well worth reading at the Park;', 'and there are others of more modern production which I', 'know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six', 'hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month', 'a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want.\"', 'Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated', 'so nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager', 'fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid', 'indolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing', 'excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous', 'self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she', 'remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled,', 'and feared she had that to communicate which might again', 'unsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time', 'this fair prospect of busy tranquillity.  Willing therefore', 'to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her', \"sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it.\", 'But the resolution was made only to be broken.', 'Marianne had been two or three days at home, before', 'the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself', 'to venture out.

I do not mean to talk to you', 'of what my feelings have been for him, but what they', 'are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on one point,', 'if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS', 'acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all,', 'if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked', 'as my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story', 'of that unfortunate girl\"--', 'She stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words', 'as she answered,', '\"If you could be assured of that, you think you', 'should be easy.\"', '\"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--', 'for not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has', 'been what HE has been to ME, of such designs,--but what must', 'it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine,', 'but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose', 'me to\"--', '\"How then,\" asked her sister, \"would you account', 'for his behaviour?\"', '\"I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him,', 'only fickle, very, very fickle.\"', 'Elinor said no more.  She was debating within herself', 'on the eligibility of beginning her story directly,', 'or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;--', 'and they crept on for a few minutes in silence.', '\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne', 'at last with a sigh, \"when I wish his secret reflections', 'may be no more unpleasant than my own.

My illness has made me think--', 'It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection.', 'Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly', 'able to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my', 'own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance', 'with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence', 'towards myself, and want of kindness to others.', 'I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings,', 'and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led', 'me to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been', 'entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my', 'own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.', 'Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I', 'did not know my danger till the danger was removed;', 'but with such feelings as these reflections gave me,', 'I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness', 'of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,', 'and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I died,--', 'in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse,', 'my friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful', 'selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the', 'murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR', 'remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have consoled', 'her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.', 'Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected,', 'or some failing indulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.', 'The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings,', 'I had repaid with ungrateful contempt.  To the Middletons,', 'to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even,', 'I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened', 'against their merits, and a temper irritated by their', 'very attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them,', 'little as they deserve, I had given less than their due.', 'But you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged', 'by me.  I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;', 'yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion', 'that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was', 'before me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate', 'of you and your comfort?  Did I imitate your forbearance,', 'or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those', 'offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude', 'which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;--', 'not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I', 'had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every', 'exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow', 'to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart', 'which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you,', 'for or I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable', 'for my sake.\"', 'Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit;', 'and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest', 'to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support', 'which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved.', 'Marianne pressed her hand and replied,', '\"You are very good.--The future must be my proof.', 'I have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering', 'to it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved.', 'They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself.', 'I shall now live solely for my family.  You, my mother,', 'and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me;', 'you will share my affections entirely between you.', '>From you, from my home, I shall never again have the smallest', 'incitement to move; and if I do mix in other society,', 'it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled,', 'my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities,', 'the lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.', 'As for Willoughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall', 'ever forget him, would be idle.  His remembrance can be overcome', 'by no change of circumstances or opinions.  But it shall', 'be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,', 'by constant employment.\"', 'She paused--and added in a low voice, \"If I could', 'but know HIS heart, everything would become easy.\"', 'Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting', 'on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding', 'her narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than', 'at first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection', 'did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself', 'leading to the fact.', 'She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address;', 'prepared her anxious listener with caution; related simply', 'and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby', 'grounded his apology; did justice to his repentance,', 'and softened only his protestations of present regard.', 'Marianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes', 'were fixed on the ground, and her lips became whiter', 'than even sickness had left them.  A thousand inquiries', 'sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one.', 'She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,', \"unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and\", 'tears covered her cheeks.', 'Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home;', 'and till they reached the door of the cottage,', 'easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be', 'though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of', 'nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together;', 'and was carefully minute in every particular of speech', 'and look, where minuteness could be safely indulged.', 'As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a kiss', 'of gratitude and these two words just articulate through', 'her tears, \"Tell mama,\" withdrew from her sister and', 'walked slowly up stairs.  Elinor would not attempt', 'to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought;', 'and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result,', 'and a resolution of reviving the subject again,', 'should Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the parlour', 'to fulfill her parting injunction.', 'CHAPTER 47', 'Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication', 'of her former favourite.  She rejoiced in his being', 'cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was', 'sorry for him;--she wished him happy.  But the feelings', 'of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore', 'him with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished,', 'to Marianne.  Nothing could do away the knowledge', 'of what the latter had suffered through his means,', 'nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.', 'Nothing could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem,', 'nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon.', \"Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby's\", 'story from himself--had she witnessed his distress,', 'and been under the influence of his countenance and his', 'manner, it is probable that her compassion would have', \"been greater.  But it was neither in Elinor's power,\", 'nor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her', 'retailed explanation, as had at first been called forth', 'in herself.  Reflection had given calmness to her judgment,', \"and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby's deserts;--\", 'she wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth,', 'and lay open such facts as were really due to his character,', 'without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the', 'fancy astray.', 'In the evening, when they were all three together,', 'Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;--', 'but that it was not without an effort, the restless,', 'unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time', 'previously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--', 'and her unsteady voice, plainly shewed.', '\"I wish to assure you both,\" said she, \"that I see', 'every thing--as you can desire me to do.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly', 'with soothing tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished', \"to hear her sister's unbiased opinion, by an eager sign,\", 'engaged her silence.  Marianne slowly continued--', '\"It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told', 'me this morning--I have now heard exactly what I', 'wished to hear.\"--For some moments her voice was lost;', 'but recovering herself, she added, and with greater', 'calmness than before--\"I am now perfectly satisfied,', 'I wish for no change.  I never could have been happy', 'with him, after knowing, as sooner or later I must', 'have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence,', 'no esteem.  Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.\"', '\"I know it--I know it,\" cried her mother.', '\"Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one', 'who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends,', 'and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart', 'to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her', 'sensitive conscience, would have felt all that the', 'conscience of her husband ought to have felt.\"', 'Marianne sighed, and repeated, \"I wish for no change.\"', '\"You consider the matter,\" said Elinor, \"exactly as', 'a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it;', 'and I dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only', 'in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough', 'to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you', 'in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which', 'you would have been poorly supported by an affection,', 'on his side, much less certain.  Had you married,', 'you must have been always poor.  His expensiveness is', 'acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares', 'that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him.', 'His demands and your inexperience together, on a small,', 'very small income, must have brought on distresses which', 'would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having been', 'entirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense', 'of honour and honesty would have led you, I know,', 'when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy', 'that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long', 'as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,', 'you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--', 'and how little could the utmost of your single management', 'do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?--', 'Beyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably,', 'to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead', 'of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it,', 'you would have lessened your own influence on his heart,', 'and made him regret the connection which had involved him', 'in such difficulties?\"', \"Marianne's lips quivered, and she repeated the word\", '\"Selfish?\" in a tone that implied--\"do you really think', 'him selfish?\"', '\"The whole of his behaviour,\" replied Elinor,', '\"from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been', 'grounded on selfishness.  It was selfishness which first', 'made him sport with your affections; which afterwards,', 'when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession', 'of it, and which finally carried him from Barton.', 'His own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular,', 'his ruling principle.\"', '\"It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object.\"', '\"At present,\" continued Elinor, \"he regrets what he', 'has done.  And why does he regret it?--Because he finds', 'it has not answered towards himself.  It has not made', 'him happy.  His circumstances are now unembarrassed--he', 'suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only', 'that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper', 'than yourself.  But does it follow that had he married you,', 'he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have', 'been different.  He would then have suffered under the', 'pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed,', 'he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife', 'of whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would', 'have been always necessitous--always poor; and probably', 'would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts', 'of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,', 'even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife.\"', '\"I have not a doubt of it,\" said Marianne; \"and I', 'have nothing to regret--nothing but my own folly.\"', '\"Rather say your mother\\'s imprudence, my child,\"', 'said Mrs. Dashwood; \"SHE must be answerable.\"', 'Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor,', 'satisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid', \"any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's\", 'spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject,', 'immediately continued,', '\"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from', \"the whole of the story--that all Willoughby's difficulties\", 'have arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his', 'behaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crime has been the origin', 'of every lesser one, and of all his present discontents.\"', 'Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark;', 'and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel', \"Brandon's injuries and merits, warm as friendship\", 'and design could unitedly dictate.  Her daughter did', 'not look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.', 'Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two', 'or three following days, that Marianne did not continue', 'to gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution', 'was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful', 'and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect', 'of time upon her health.', 'Margaret returned, and the family were again all', 'restored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage;', 'and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite', 'so much vigour as when they first came to Barton,', 'at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.', 'Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.', 'She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London,', 'nothing new of his plans, nothing certain even of his', 'present abode.  Some letters had passed between her', \"and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness;\", \"and in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:--\", '\"We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no', 'enquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him', 'to be still at Oxford;\" which was all the intelligence', 'of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name', 'was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.', 'She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of', 'his measures.', 'Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter', 'on business; and when, as he waited at table, he had', 'satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event', 'of his errand, this was his voluntary communication--', '\"I suppose you know, ma\\'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.\"', 'Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes', 'upon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her', 'chair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she', \"answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively taken\", \"the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's\", 'countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment', \"afterwards, alike distressed by Marianne's situation,\", 'knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention.', 'The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was', 'taken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids,', \"who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance, supported her into\", 'the other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather better,', 'and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret', 'and the maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still', 'much disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason', 'and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas,', 'as to the source of his intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwood', 'immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor', 'had the benefit of the information without the exertion', 'of seeking it.', '\"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?\"', '\"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma\\'am, this morning', 'in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was.  They was', 'stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn,', 'as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park', 'to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened', 'to look up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly', 'it was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat,', 'and she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you,', \"ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne,\", \"and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's,\", 'their best compliments and service, and how sorry they', 'was they had not time to come on and see you, but they was', 'in a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further', 'down for a little while, but howsever, when they come back,', 'they\\'d make sure to come and see you.\"', '\"But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?\"', '\"Yes, ma\\'am. She smiled, and said how she', 'had changed her name since she was in these parts.', 'She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady,', 'and very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her joy.\"', '\"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?\"', '\"Yes, ma\\'am, I just see him leaning back in it,', 'but he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much', 'for talking.\"', \"Elinor's heart could easily account for his not\", 'putting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably', 'found the same explanation.', '\"Was there no one else in the carriage?\"', '\"No, ma\\'am, only they two.\"', '\"Do you know where they came from?\"', '\"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--', 'Mrs. Ferrars told me.\"', '\"And are they going farther westward?\"', '\"Yes, ma\\'am--but not to bide long.  They will soon', 'be back again, and then they\\'d be sure and call here.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter;', 'but Elinor knew better than to expect them.', 'She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and was', 'very confident that Edward would never come near them.', 'She observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they', \"were probably going down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.\", \"Thomas's intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked\", 'as if she wished to hear more.', '\"Did you see them off, before you came away?\"', '\"No, ma\\'am--the horses were just coming out, but I', 'could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late.\"', '\"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?\"', '\"Yes, ma\\'am, she said how she was very well;', 'and to my mind she was always a very handsome young', 'lady--and she seemed vastly contented.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question,', 'and Thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless,', 'were soon afterwards dismissed.  Marianne had already sent', \"to say, that she should eat nothing more.  Mrs. Dashwood's\", \"and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret\", 'might think herself very well off, that with so much', 'uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced,', 'so much reason as they had often had to be careless', 'of their meals, she had never been obliged to go without', 'her dinner before.', 'When the dessert and the wine were arranged,', 'and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves,', 'they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness', 'and silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark,', 'and ventured not to offer consolation.  She now found', \"that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation\", 'of herself; and justly concluded that every thing', 'had been expressly softened at the time, to spare her', 'from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then', 'had suffered for Marianne.  She found that she had been', 'misled by the careful, the considerate attention of', 'her daughter, to think the attachment, which once she', 'had so well understood, much slighter in reality, than', 'she had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved', 'to be.  She feared that under this persuasion she had', 'been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;--', \"that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged,\", 'more immediately before her, had too much engrossed', 'her tenderness, and led her away to forget that in Elinor', 'she might have a daughter suffering almost as much,', 'certainly with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.', 'CHAPTER 48', 'Elinor now found the difference between the expectation', 'of an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told', 'to consider it, and certainty itself.  She now found, that', 'in spite of herself, she had always admitted a hope,', 'while Edward remained single, that something would occur', 'to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of', 'his own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible', 'opportunity of establishment for the lady, would arise', 'to assist the happiness of all.  But he was now married;', 'and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery,', 'which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.', 'That he should be married soon, before (as she imagined)', 'he could be in orders, and consequently before he could', 'be in possession of the living, surprised her a little', 'at first.  But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy,', 'in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him,', 'should overlook every thing but the risk of delay.', 'They were married, married in town, and now hastening', \"down to her uncle's.  What had Edward felt on being within\", \"four miles from Barton, on seeing her mother's servant,\", \"on hearing Lucy's message!\", 'They would soon, she supposed, be settled at', 'Delaford.--Delaford,--that place in which so much', 'conspired to give her an interest; which she wished', 'to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.', 'She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw', 'in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once', 'a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality,', 'and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;--', 'pursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the', 'favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every', 'wealthy friend.  In Edward--she knew not what she saw,', 'nor what she wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing', 'pleased her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.', 'Elinor flattered herself that some one of their', 'connections in London would write to them to announce', 'the event, and give farther particulars,--but day after', 'day passed off, and brought no letter, no tidings.', 'Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found', 'fault with every absent friend.  They were all thoughtless', 'or indolent.', '\"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma\\'am?\"', 'was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience', 'of her mind to have something going on.', '\"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather', 'expect to see, than to hear from him again.  I earnestly', 'pressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised', 'to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.\"', 'This was gaining something, something to look forward to.', 'Colonel Brandon must have some information to give.', 'Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure', 'of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window.', 'He stopt at their gate.  It was a gentleman, it', 'was Colonel Brandon himself.  Now she could hear more;', 'and she trembled in expectation of it.  But--it was', 'NOT Colonel Brandon--neither his air--nor his height.', 'Were it possible, she must say it must be Edward.', 'She looked again.  He had just dismounted;--she could not be', 'mistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She moved away and sat down.', '\"He comes from Mr. Pratt\\'s purposely to see us.  I WILL be', 'calm; I WILL be mistress of myself.\"', 'In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise', 'aware of the mistake.  She saw her mother and Marianne', 'change colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper', 'a few sentences to each other.  She would have given', 'the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand', 'that she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear', 'in their behaviour to him;--but she had no utterance,', 'and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion.', 'Not a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited', 'in silence for the appearance of their visitor.', 'His footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment', 'he was in the passage, and in another he was before them.', 'His countenance, as he entered the room, was not', 'too happy, even for Elinor.  His complexion was white', 'with agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his', 'reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.', 'Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted,', 'to the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant', 'in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing,', 'met with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand,', 'and wished him joy.', 'He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.', \"Elinor's lips had moved with her mother's, and, when the\", 'moment of action was over, she wished that she had shaken', 'hands with him too.  But it was then too late, and with a', 'countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again', 'and talked of the weather.', 'Marianne had retreated as much as possible', 'out of sight, to conceal her distress; and Margaret,', 'understanding some part, but not the whole of the case,', 'thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore', 'took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained', 'a strict silence.', 'When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness', 'of the season, a very awful pause took place.  It was put', 'an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged to hope that he', 'had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In a hurried manner,', 'he replied in the affirmative.', 'Another pause.', 'Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing', 'the sound of her own voice, now said,', '\"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?\"', '\"At Longstaple!\" he replied, with an air of surprise.--', '\"No, my mother is in town.\"', '\"I meant,\" said Elinor, taking up some work from', 'the table, \"to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.\"', 'She dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both', 'turned their eyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed,', 'looked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,--', '\"Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs.', 'ROBERT Ferrars.\"', '\"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!\"--was repeated by Marianne and her', 'mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though', 'Elinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on him', 'with the same impatient wonder.  He rose from his seat,', 'and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing', 'what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there,', 'and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting', 'the latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,', '\"Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard', 'that my brother is lately married to--to the youngest--to', 'Miss Lucy Steele.\"', 'His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment', 'by all but Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over', 'her work, in a state of such agitation as made her hardly', 'know where she was.', '\"Yes,\" said he, \"they were married last week,', 'and are now at Dawlish.\"', 'Elinor could sit it no longer.  She almost ran', 'out of the room, and as soon as the door was closed,', 'burst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would', 'never cease.  Edward, who had till then looked any where,', 'rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--', 'or even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards', 'he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries,', 'no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate,', 'and at last, without saying a word, quitted the room,', 'and walked out towards the village--leaving the others', 'in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change', 'in his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity', 'which they had no means of lessening but by their', 'own conjectures.', 'CHAPTER 49', 'Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his', 'release might appear to the whole family, it was certain', 'that Edward was free; and to what purpose that freedom would', 'be employed was easily pre-determined by all;--for after', 'experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement,', \"contracted without his mother's consent, as he had already\", 'done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected', 'of him in the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction', 'of another.', 'His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.', 'It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering', 'that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question,', 'it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable', 'in the present case as he really did, so much in need of', 'encouragement and fresh air.', 'How soon he had walked himself into the proper', 'resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising', 'it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself,', 'and how he was received, need not be particularly told.', 'This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to', \"table at four o'clock, about three hours after his arrival,\", \"he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent,\", 'and was not only in the rapturous profession of', 'the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth,', 'one of the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was', 'more than commonly joyful.  He had more than the ordinary', 'triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise', 'his spirits.  He was released without any reproach', 'to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed', 'his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--', 'and elevated at once to that security with another,', 'which he must have thought of almost with despair,', 'as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire.', 'He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from', 'misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken', 'in such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness,', 'as his friends had never witnessed in him before.', 'His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses,', 'all its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment', 'to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.', '\"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\"', 'said he, \"the consequence of ignorance of the world--', 'and want of employment.

The selfish sagacity of the latter,', 'which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape,', 'was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it;', 'for her respectful humility, assiduous attentions,', 'and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening', 'was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars', 'to his choice, and re-established him completely in', 'her favour.', \"The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair,\", 'and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held', 'forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest,', 'an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress', 'may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every', 'advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time', 'and conscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance,', \"and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings,\", 'it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother.', 'He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;', 'and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection', 'of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews', 'would settle the matter.  In that point, however,', 'and that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him', 'hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME,', 'another visit, another conversation, was always wanted', 'to produce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered', 'in her mind when they parted, which could only be', \"removed by another half hour's discourse with himself.\", 'His attendance was by this means secured, and the rest', 'followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward,', 'they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject', 'on which he had always more to say than on any other,', 'and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal', 'to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident', 'to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.', 'He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward,', 'and very proud of marrying privately without his', \"mother's consent.  What immediately followed is known.\", 'They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish;', 'for she had many relations and old acquaintances to', 'cut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--', 'and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness', 'of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it,', \"which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted.  The forgiveness,\", 'at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert;', 'and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore', 'could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks', 'longer unpardoned.

On the shelves were jars', 'of butter, and cheeses in bags and out of bags. Overhead hung bunches of', 'sausages, and there were spicy apples in barrels standing about. It', \"smelt so good that it went to the little Country Mouse's head. He ran\", 'along the shelf and nibbled at a cheese here, and a bit of butter there,', 'until he saw an especially rich, very delicious-smelling piece of cheese', 'on a queer little stand in a corner. He was just on the point of putting', 'his teeth into the cheese when the City Mouse saw him.', '\"Stop! stop!\" cried the City Mouse. \"That is a trap!\"', 'The little Country Mouse stopped and said, \"What is a trap?\"', '\"That thing is a trap,\" said the little City Mouse. \"The minute you', 'touch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head', 'hard, and you\\'re dead.\"', 'The little Country Mouse looked at the trap, and he looked at the', 'cheese, and he looked at the little City Mouse. \"If you\\'ll excuse me,\"', 'he said, \"I think I will go home.

The Moon laughed at the sight; but when Little Jack Rollaround', 'saw the Moon, he called out, \"Open the door, old Moon!

It was', 'such a fine shiny little acorn that he thought he would take it home', 'with him; so he put out his paw to touch it, but the little acorn rolled', 'away from him. He ran after it, but it kept rolling on, just ahead of', 'him, till it came to a place where a big oak-tree had its roots spread', 'all over the ground. Then it rolled under a big round root.', 'Little Mr Field Mouse ran to the root and poked his nose under after the', 'acorn, and there he saw a small round hole in the ground.

Down, down, down, rolled the acorn, and down, down, down, went the', 'Field Mouse, until suddenly he saw a tiny door at the foot of the', 'stairs.', 'The shiny acorn rolled to the door and struck against it with a tap.', 'Quickly the little door opened and the acorn rolled inside.

Early', 'in the morning he said to his old mother, \"Have the kettle boiling when', \"I come home to-night, for I'll be bringing the little Red Hen for\", 'supper.\" Then he took a big bag and slung it over his shoulder, and', \"walked till he came to the little Red Hen's house. The little Red Hen\", 'was just coming out of her door to pick up a few sticks for firewood. So', 'the old Fox hid behind the wood-pile, and as soon as she bent down to', 'get a stick, into the house he slipped, and scurried behind the door.', 'In a minute the little Red Hen came quickly in, and shut the door and', 'locked it. \"I\\'m glad I\\'m safely in,\" she said. Just as she said it, she', 'turned round, and there stood the ugly old Fox, with his big bag over', 'his shoulder. Whiff! how scared the little Red Hen was! She dropped her', 'apronful of sticks, and flew up to the big beam across the ceiling.', 'There she perched, and she said to the old Fox, down below, \"You may as', 'well go home, for you can\\'t get me.\"', '\"Can\\'t I, though!\" said the Fox. And what do you think he did? He stood', 'on the floor underneath the little Red Hen and twirled round in a circle', 'after his own tail. And as he spun, and spun, and spun, faster, and', 'faster, and faster, the poor little Red Hen got so dizzy watching him', \"that she couldn't hold on to the perch. She dropped off, and the old Fox\", 'picked her up and put her in his bag, slung the bag over his shoulder,', 'and started for home, where the kettle was boiling.', 'He had a very long way to go, up hill, and the little Red Hen was still', \"so dizzy that she didn't know where she was. But when the dizziness\", 'began to go off, she whisked her little scissors out of her apron', 'pocket, and snip! she cut a little hole in the bag; then she poked her', 'head out and saw where she was, and as soon as they came to a good spot', 'she cut the hole bigger and jumped out herself. There was a great big', 'stone lying there, and the little Red Hen picked it up and put it in the', 'bag as quick as a wink. Then she ran as fast as she could till she came', 'to her own little farmhouse, and she went in and locked the door with', 'the big key.', 'The old Fox went on carrying the stone and never knew the difference.', 'My, but it bumped him well! He was pretty tired when he got home. But he', 'was so pleased to think of the supper he was going to have that he did', 'not mind that at all.

They made a wonderful', 'big pumpkin out of the wheelbarrow, trimmed with yellow paper, and', 'Cinderella rolled away in it, when the fairy godmother waved her wand.', 'One other beautiful story they used to play. It was the story of', \"_Pilgrim's Progress_; if you have never heard it, you must be sure to\", 'read it as soon as you can read well enough to understand the', 'old-fashioned words. The little girls used to put shells in their hats', 'for a sign they were on a pilgrimage, as the old pilgrims used to do;', 'then they made journeys over the hill behind the house, and through the', 'woods, and down the lanes; and when the pilgrimage was over they had', 'apples and nuts to eat, in the happy land of home.', 'Louisa loved all these plays, and she made some of her own and wrote', 'them down so that the children could act them.', 'But better than fun or writing Louisa loved her mother, and by and by,', 'as the little girl began to grow into a big girl, she felt very sad to', 'see her dear mother work so hard. She helped all she could with the', 'housework, but nothing could really help the tired mother except money;', 'she needed money for food and clothes, and someone grown up, to help in', 'the house. But there never was enough money for these things, and', \"Louisa's mother grew more and more weary, and sometimes ill. I cannot\", 'tell you how much Louisa suffered over this.', 'At last, as Louisa thought about it, she came to care more about helping', 'her mother and her father and her sisters than about anything else in', 'all the world. And she began to work very hard to earn money. She sewed', 'for people, and when she was a little older she taught some little girls', 'their lessons, and then she wrote stories for the papers. Every bit of', 'money she earned, except what she had to use, she gave to her dear', 'family. It helped very much, but it was so little that Louisa never felt', 'as if she were doing anything.', 'Every year she grew more unselfish, and every year she worked harder.', 'She liked writing stories best of all her work, but she did not get much', 'money for them, and some people told her she was wasting her time.', 'At last, one day, a publisher asked Louisa, who was now a woman, to', 'write a book for girls. Louisa was not very well, and she was very', 'tired, but she always said, \"I\\'ll try,\" when she had a chance to work;', 'so she said, \"I\\'ll try,\" to the publisher. When she thought about the', 'book she remembered the good times she used to have with her sisters in', 'the big, bare house in the country. And so she wrote a story and put all', 'that in it; she put her dear mother and her wise father in it, and all', 'the little sisters, and besides the jolly times and the plays, she put', 'the sad, hard times in,--the work and worry and going without things.', 'When the book was written, she called it _Little Women_, and sent it to', 'the publisher.', 'And, children, the little book made Louisa famous. It was so sweet and', 'funny and sad and real,--like our own lives,--that everybody wanted to', 'read it. Everybody bought it, and much money came from it. After so many', \"years, little Louisa's wish came true: she bought a nice house for her\", 'family; she sent one of her sisters to Europe, to study; she gave her', 'father books; but best of all, she was able to see to it that the', 'beloved mother, so tired and so ill, could have rest and happiness.', 'Never again did the dear mother have to do any hard work, and she had', 'pretty things about her all the rest of her life.', \"Louisa Alcott, for that was Louisa's name, wrote many beautiful books\", 'after this, and she became one of the most famous women of America.

When she had unkind or dissatisfied thoughts,', 'she tried to get rid of them by playing they were enemies of the', 'kingdom; and she drove them out with soldiers; the soldiers were', 'patience, duty, and love.

It happened that\", 'I did not read it for myself or hear it again during my childhood. One', 'Christmas Day, when I was grown up, I found myself at a loss for the', '\"one more\" story called for by some little children with whom I was', 'spending the holiday. In the mental search for buried treasure which', 'ensued, I came upon one or two word-impressions of the experiences of', 'the Little Fir Tree, and forthwith wove them into what I supposed to be', 'something of a reproduction of the original. The latter part of the', 'story had wholly faded from my memory, so that I \"made up\" to suit the', 'tastes of my audience. Afterward I told the story to a good many', 'children, at one time or another, and it gradually took the shape it has', 'here. It was not until several years later that, in rereading Andersen', 'for other purposes, I came upon the real story of the Little Fir Tree,', 'and read it for myself. Then indeed I was amused, and somewhat', 'distressed, to find how far I had wandered from the text.', 'I give this explanation that the reader may know I do not presume to', 'offer the little tale which follows as an \"adaptation\" of Andersen\\'s', 'famous story. I offer it plainly as a story which children have liked,', \"and which grew out of my early memories of Andersen's _The Little Fir\", 'Tree_.', 'Once there was a Little Fir Tree, slim and pointed, and shiny, which', 'stood in the great forest in the midst of some big fir trees, broad, and', 'tall, and shadowy green. The Little Fir Tree was very unhappy because he', 'was not big like the others. When the birds came flying into the woods', 'and lit on the branches of the big trees and built their nests there, he', 'used to call up to them,--', '\"Come down, come down, rest in my branches!\" But they always said,--', '\"Oh, no, no; you are too little!\"', 'When the splendid wind came blowing and singing through the forest, it', 'bent and rocked and swung the tops of the big trees, and murmured to', 'them. Then the Little Fir Tree looked up, and called,--', '\"Oh, please, dear wind, come down and play with me!\" But he always', 'said,--', '\"Oh, no; you are too little, you are too little!\"', 'In the winter the white snow fell softly, softly, and covered the great', 'trees all over with wonderful caps and coats of white. The Little Fir', 'Tree, close down in the cover of the others, would call up,--', '\"Oh, please, dear snow, give me a cap, too! I want to play, too!\" But', 'the snow always said,--', '\"Oh no, no, no; you are too little, you are too little!\"', 'The worst of all was when men came into the wood, with sledges and teams', 'of horses. They came to cut the big trees down and carry them away.', 'Whenever one had been cut down and carried away the others talked about', 'it, and nodded their heads, and the Little Fir Tree listened, and heard', 'them say that when you were carried away so, you might become the mast', 'of a mighty ship, and go far away over the ocean, and see many wonderful', 'things; or you might be part of a fine house in a great city, and see', 'much of life. The Little Fir Tree wanted greatly to see life, but he', 'was always too little; the men passed him by.', \"But by and by, one cold winter's morning, men came with a sledge and\", 'horses, and after they had cut here and there they came to the circle of', 'trees round the Little Fir Tree, and looked all about.', '\"There are none little enough,\" they said.', 'Oh! how the Little Fir Tree pricked up his needles!', '\"Here is one,\" said one of the men, \"it is just little enough.\" And he', 'touched the Little Fir Tree.', 'The Little Fir Tree was happy as a bird, because he knew they were about', 'to cut him down. And when he was being carried away on the sledge he lay', 'wondering, _so_ contentedly, whether he should be the mast of a ship or', 'part of a fine city house. But when they came to the town he was taken', 'out and set upright in a tub and placed on the edge of a path in a row', 'of other fir trees, all small, but none so little as he. And then the', 'Little Fir Tree began to see life.', 'People kept coming to look at the trees and to take them away. But', 'always when they saw the Little Fir Tree they shook their heads and', 'said,--', '\"It is too little, too little.\"', 'Until, finally, two children came along, hand in hand, looking', 'carefully at all the small trees. When they saw the Little Fir Tree they', 'cried out,--', '\"We\\'ll take this one; it is just little enough!\"', 'They took him out of his tub and carried him away, between them. And the', 'happy Little Fir Tree spent all his time wondering what it could be that', 'he was just little enough for; he knew it could hardly be a mast or a', 'house, since he was going away with children.', 'He kept wondering, while they took him in through some big doors, and', 'set him up in another tub, on the table, in a bare little room. Very', 'soon they went away, and came back again with a big basket, which they', 'carried between them. Then some pretty ladies, with white caps on their', 'heads and white aprons over their blue dresses, came bringing little', 'parcels. The children took things out of the basket and began to play', 'with the Little Fir Tree, just as he had often begged the wind and the', 'snow and the birds to do. He felt their soft little touches on his head', 'and his twigs and his branches. When he looked down at himself, as far', 'as he could look, he saw that he was all hung with gold and silver', 'chains! There were strings of white fluffy stuff drooping around him;', 'his twigs held little gold nuts and pink, rosy balls and silver stars;', 'he had pretty little pink and white candles in his arms; but last, and', 'most wonderful of all, the children hung a beautiful white, floating', 'doll-angel over his head! The Little Fir Tree could not breathe, for joy', 'and wonder. What was it that he was, now? Why was this glory for him?', 'After a time every one went away and left him. It grew dusk, and the', 'Little Fir Tree began to hear strange sounds through the closed doors.', 'Sometimes he heard a child crying. He was beginning to be lonely. It', 'grew more and more shadowy.', 'All at once, the doors opened and the two children came in. Two of the', 'pretty ladies were with them. They came up to the Little Fir Tree and', 'quickly lighted all the little pink and white candles. Then the two', 'pretty ladies took hold of the table with the Little Fir Tree on it and', 'pushed it, very smoothly and quickly, out of the doors, across a hall,', 'and in at another door.', 'The Little Fir Tree had a sudden sight of a long room with many little', 'white beds in it, of children propped up on pillows in the beds, and of', 'other children in great wheeled chairs, and others hobbling about or', 'sitting in little chairs. He wondered why all the little children looked', 'so white and tired; he did not know that he was in a hospital. But', 'before he could wonder any more his breath was quite taken away by the', 'shout those little white children gave.', '\"Oh! oh! m-m! m-m!\" they cried.', '\"How pretty! How beautiful! Oh, isn\\'t it lovely!\"', 'He knew they must mean him, for all their shining eyes were looking', 'straight at him. He stood as straight as a mast, and quivered in every', 'needle, for joy. Presently one little weak child-voice called out,--', '\"It\\'s the nicest Christmas tree I ever saw!\"', 'And then, at last, the Little Fir Tree knew what he was; he was a', 'Christmas tree! And from his shiny head to his feet he was glad, through', 'and through, because he was just little enough to be the nicest kind of', 'tree in the world!', 'HOW MOSES WAS SAVED', 'Thousands of years ago, many years before David lived, there was a very', 'wise and good man of his people who was a friend and adviser of the king', 'of Egypt. And for love of this friend, the king of Egypt had let numbers', 'of the Israelites settle in his land. But after the king and his', 'Israelitish friend were dead, there was a new king, who hated the', 'Israelites. When he saw how strong they were, and how many there were of', 'them, he began to be afraid that some day they might number more than', 'the Egyptians, and might take his land from him.', 'Then he and his rulers did a wicked thing. They made the Israelites', 'slaves. And they gave them terrible tasks to do, without proper rest, or', 'food, or clothes. For they hoped that the hardship would kill off the', 'Israelites. They thought the old men would die and the young men be so', 'ill and weary that they could not bring up families, and so the race', 'would dwindle away.', 'But in spite of the work and suffering, the Israelites remained strong,', 'and more and more boys grew up, to make the king afraid.', 'Then he did the most wicked thing of all. He ordered his soldiers to', 'kill every boy baby that should be born in an Israelitish family; he did', 'not care about the girls, because they could not grow up to fight.', 'Very soon after this wicked order, a boy baby was born in a certain', 'Israelitish family. When his mother first looked at him her heart was', 'nearly broken, for he was even more beautiful than most babies are,--so', 'strong and fair and sweet. But he was a boy! How could she save him from', 'death?', 'Somehow, she contrived to keep him hidden for three whole months. But at', 'the end of that time, she saw that it would not be possible to keep him', 'safe any longer. She had been thinking all this time about what she', 'should do, and now she carried out her plan.', 'First, she took a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it all over with', 'pitch, so that it was water-tight, and then she laid the baby in it;', 'then she carried it to the edge of the river and laid it in the flags by', \"the river's brink. It did not show at all, unless one were quite near\", 'it. Then she kissed her little son and left him there. But his sister', 'stood far off, not seeming to watch, but really watching carefully to', 'see what would happen to the baby.', 'Soon there was the sound of talk and laughter, and a train of beautiful', \"women came down to the water's edge. It was the king's daughter, come\", 'down to bathe in the river, with her maidens. The maidens walked along', 'by the river side.', \"As the king's daughter came near to the water, she saw the strange\", 'little basket lying in the flags, and she sent her maid to bring it to', 'her. And when she had opened it, she saw the child; the poor baby was', 'crying. When she saw him, so helpless and so beautiful, crying for his', \"mother, the king's daughter pitied him and loved him. She knew the cruel\", 'order of her father, and she said at once, \"This is one of the Hebrews\\'', 'children.\"', 'At that moment the baby\\'s sister came to the princess and said, \"Shall I', 'go and find thee a nurse from the Hebrew women, so that she may nurse', 'the child for thee?\" Not a word did she say about whose child it was,', \"but perhaps the princess guessed; I don't know. At all events, she told\", 'the little girl to go.', 'So the maiden went, and brought her mother!', 'Then the king\\'s daughter said to the baby\\'s mother, \"Take this child', 'away and nurse it for me, and I will give thee wages.\"', \"Was not that a strange thing? And can you think how happy the baby's\", \"mother was? For now the baby would be known only as the princess's\", 'adopted child, and would be safe.', 'And it was so. The mother kept him until he was old enough to be taken', \"to the princess's palace. Then he was brought and given to the king's\", 'daughter, and he became her son. And she named him Moses.', 'But the strangest part of the whole story is, that when Moses grew to be', 'a man he became so strong and wise that it was he who at last saved his', 'people from the king and rescued them from the Egyptians. The one child', \"saved by the king's own daughter was the very one the king would most\", 'have wanted to kill, if he had known.', 'THE TEN FAIRIES', 'Once upon a time there was a dear little girl, whose name was Elsa.', \"Elsa's father and mother worked very hard and became rich. But they\", 'loved Elsa so much that they did not like her to do any work; very', 'foolishly, they let her play all the time. So when Elsa grew up, she did', 'not know how to do anything; she could not make bread, she could not', 'sweep a room, she could not sew a seam; she could only laugh and sing.', 'But she was so sweet and merry that everybody loved her. And by and by,', 'she married one of the people who loved her, and had a house of her own', 'to take care of.', 'Then, then, my dears, came hard times for Elsa! There were so many', 'things to be done in the house, and she did not know how to do any of', 'them! And because she had never worked at all it made her very tired', 'even to try; she was tired before the morning was over, every day. The', 'maid would come and say, \"How shall I do this?\" or \"How shall I do', 'that?\" and Elsa would have to say, \"I don\\'t know.\" Then the maid would', 'pretend that she did not know, either; and when she saw her mistress', 'sitting about doing nothing, she, too, sat about, idle.', \"Elsa's husband had a hard time of it; he had only poor food to eat, and\", 'it was not ready at the right time, and the house looked all in a', 'muddle. It made him sad, and that made Elsa sad, for she wanted to do', 'everything just right.', \"At last, one day, Elsa's husband went away quite cross; he said to her,\", 'as he went out of the door, \"It is no wonder that the house looks so,', 'when you sit all day with your hands in your lap!\"', 'Little Elsa cried bitterly when he was gone, for she did not want to', 'make her husband unhappy and cross, and she wanted the house to look', 'nice. \"Oh, dear,\" she sobbed, \"I wish I could do things right! I wish I', 'could work! I wish--I wish I had ten good fairies to work for me! Then I', 'could keep the house!\"', 'As she said the words, a great grey man stood before her; he was wrapped', 'in a strange grey cloak that covered him from head to foot; and he', 'smiled at Elsa. \"What is the matter, dear?\" he said. \"Why do you cry?\"', '\"Oh, I am crying because I do not know how to keep the house,\" said', 'Elsa. \"I cannot make bread, I cannot sweep, I cannot sew a seam; when I', 'was a little girl I never learned to work, and now I cannot do anything', 'right. I wish I had ten good fairies to help me!\"', '\"You shall have them, dear,\" said the grey man, and he shook his strange', 'grey cloak. Pouf! Out hopped ten tiny fairies, no bigger than that!', '\"These shall be your servants, Elsa,\" said the grey man; \"they are', 'faithful and clever, and they will do everything you want them to, just', 'right. But the neighbours might stare and ask questions if they saw', 'these little chaps running about your house, so I will hide them away', 'for you. Give me your little useless hands.\"', 'Wondering, Elsa stretched out her pretty, little, white hands.', '\"Now stretch out your little useless fingers, dear!\"', 'Elsa stretched out her pretty pink fingers.', 'The grey man touched each one of the ten little fingers, and as he', 'touched them he said their names: \"Little Thumb; Forefinger;', 'Thimble-finger; Ring-finger; Little Finger; Little Thumb; Forefinger;', 'Thimble-finger; Ring-finger; Little Finger!\" And as he named the', 'fingers, one after another, the tiny fairies bowed their tiny heads;', 'there was a fairy for every name.', '\"Hop! hide yourselves away!\" said the grey man.', \"Hop, hop! The fairies sprang to Elsa's knee, then to the palms of her\", 'hands, and then--whisk! they were all hidden away in her little pink', 'fingers, a fairy in every finger! And the grey man was gone.', 'Elsa sat and looked with wonder at her little white hands and the ten', 'useless fingers. But suddenly the little fingers began to stir. The tiny', 'fairies who were hidden away there were not used to remaining still, and', 'they were getting restless. They stirred so that Elsa jumped up and ran', 'to the cooking table, and took hold of the bread board. No sooner had', 'she touched the bread board than the little fairies began to work: they', 'measured the flour, mixed the bread, kneaded the loaves, and set them to', 'rise, quicker than you could wink; and when the bread was done, it was', 'as nice as you could wish. Then the little fairy-fingers seized the', 'broom, and in a twinkling they were making the house clean. And so it', 'went, all day. Elsa flew about from one thing to another, and the ten', 'fairies did the work, just right.', 'When the maid saw her mistress working, she began to work, too; and when', 'she saw how beautifully everything was done, she was ashamed to do', 'anything badly herself. In a little while the housework was going', 'smoothly, and Elsa could laugh and sing again.', \"There was no more crossness in that house. Elsa's husband grew so proud\", 'of her that he went about saying to everybody, \"My grandmother was a', 'fine housekeeper, and my mother was a fine housekeeper, but neither of', 'them could hold a candle to my wife. She has only one maid, but, to see', 'the work done, you would think she had as many servants as she has', 'fingers on her hands!\"', 'When Elsa heard that, she used to laugh, but she never, never told.', 'THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER', 'Once upon a time there was an honest shoemaker, who was very poor. He', 'worked as hard as he could, and still he could not earn enough to keep', 'himself and his wife. At last there came a day when he had nothing left', 'but one piece of leather, big enough to make one pair of shoes. He cut', 'out the shoes, ready to stitch, and left them on the bench; then he said', 'his prayers and went to bed, trusting that he could finish the shoes on', 'the next day and sell them.', 'Bright and early the next morning, he rose and went to his work bench.', 'There lay a pair of shoes, beautifully made, and the leather was gone!', 'There was no sign of anyone having been there. The shoemaker and his', 'wife did not know what to make of it. But the first customer who came', 'was so pleased with the beautiful shoes that he bought them, and paid so', 'much that the shoemaker was able to buy leather enough for two pairs.', 'Happily, he cut them out, and then, as it was late, he left the pieces', 'on the bench, ready to sew in the morning. But when morning came, two', 'pairs of shoes lay on the bench, most beautifully made, and no sign of', 'anyone who had been there. The shoemaker and his wife were quite at a', 'loss.', 'That day a customer came and bought both pairs, and paid so much for', 'them that the shoemaker bought leather for four pairs, with the money.', 'Once more he cut out the shoes and left them on the bench. And in the', 'morning all four pairs were made.', 'It went on like this until the shoemaker and his wife were prosperous', 'people. But they could not be satisfied to have so much done for them', 'and not know to whom they should be grateful. So one night, after the', 'shoemaker had left the pieces of leather on the bench, he and his wife', 'hid themselves behind a curtain, and left a light in the room.', 'Just as the clock struck twelve the door opened softly, and two tiny', 'elves came dancing into the room, hopped on to the bench, and began to', 'put the pieces together. They were quite naked, but they had wee little', 'scissors and hammers and thread. Tap! tap! went the little hammers;', 'stitch, stitch, went the thread, and the little elves were hard at work.', 'No one ever worked so fast as they. In almost no time all the shoes were', \"stitched and finished. Then the tiny elves took hold of each other's\", 'hands and danced round the shoes on the bench, till the shoemaker and', 'his wife had hard work not to laugh aloud. But as the clock struck two,', 'the little creatures whisked away out of the window, and left the room', 'all as it was before.', 'The shoemaker and his wife looked at each other, and said, \"How can we', 'thank the little elves who have made us happy and prosperous?\"', '\"I should like to make them some pretty clothes,\" said the wife, \"they', 'are quite naked.\"', '\"I will make the shoes if you will make the coats,\" said her husband.', 'That very day they commenced their task. The wife cut out two tiny, tiny', 'coats of green, two weeny, weeny waistcoats of yellow, two little pairs', 'of trousers, of white, two bits of caps, bright red (for every one knows', 'the elves love bright colours), and her husband made two little pairs of', 'shoes with long, pointed toes. They made the wee clothes as dainty as', 'could be, with nice little stitches and pretty buttons; and by Christmas', 'time, they were finished.', 'On Christmas eve, the shoemaker cleaned his bench, and on it, instead of', 'leather, he laid the two sets of gay little fairy-clothes. Then he and', 'his wife hid away as before, to watch.', 'Promptly at midnight, the little naked elves came in. They hopped upon', 'the bench; but when they saw the little clothes there, they laughed and', 'danced for joy. Each one caught up his little coat and things and began', 'to put them on. Then they looked at each other and made all kinds of', 'funny motions in their delight. At last they began to dance, and when', 'the clock struck two, they danced quite away, out of the window.', 'They never came back any more, but from that day they gave the shoemaker', 'and his wife good luck, so that they never needed any more help.', \"WHO KILLED THE OTTER'S BABIES?\", 'Once the Otter came to the Mouse-deer and said, \"Friend Mouse-deer, will', 'you please take care of my babies while I go to the river, to catch', 'fish?\"', '\"Certainly,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"go along.\"', 'But when the Otter came back from the river, with a string of fish, he', 'found his babies crushed flat.', '\"What does this mean, Friend Mouse-deer?\" he said. \"Who killed my', 'children while you were taking care of them?\"', '\"I am very sorry,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"but you know I am Chief Dancer', 'of the War-dance, and the Woodpecker came and sounded the war-gong, so I', 'danced.

It was a valley of brown, bare, desert', 'soil, in a climate where almost no rain falls; but the snow on the', 'mountain-tops sent down little streams of pure water, the winds were', 'gentle, and lying like a blue jewel at the foot of the western hills was', 'a marvellous lake of salt water,--an inland sea. So the pioneers settled', 'there and built themselves huts and cabins for the first winter.', 'It had taken them many months to make the terrible journey; many had', 'died of weariness and illness on the way; many died of hardship during', 'the winter; and the provisions they had brought in their wagons were so', 'nearly gone that, by spring, they were living partly on roots, dug from', 'the ground. All their lives now depended on the crops of grain and', 'vegetables which they could raise in the valley. They made the barren', 'land fertile by spreading water from the little streams over it,--what', 'we call \"irrigating\"; and they planted enough corn and grain and', 'vegetables for all the people. Every one helped, and every one watched', 'for the sprouting, with hopes, and prayers, and careful eyes.', 'In good time the seeds sprouted, and the dry, brown earth was covered', \"with a carpet of tender, green, growing things. No farmer's garden could\", 'have looked better than the great garden of the desert valley. And from', 'day to day the little shoots grew and flourished till they were all well', 'above the ground.', 'Then a terrible thing happened. One day, the men who were watering the', 'crops saw a great number of crickets swarming over the ground at the', 'edge of the gardens nearest the mountains. They were hopping from the', 'barren places into the young, green crops, and as they settled down they', 'ate the tiny shoots and leaves to the ground. More came, and more, and', 'ever more, and as they came they spread out till they covered a big', 'corner of the grain field. And still more and more, till it was like an', 'army of black, hopping, crawling crickets, streaming down the side of', 'the mountain to kill the crops.', 'The men tried to kill the crickets by beating them down, but the', 'numbers were so great that it was like beating at the sea. Then they ran', 'and told the terrible news, and all the village came to help. They', 'started fires; they dug trenches and filled them with water; they ran', 'wildly about in the fields, killing what they could. But while they', 'fought in one place new armies of crickets marched down the', 'mountain-sides and attacked the fields in other places. And at last the', 'people fell on their knees and wept and cried in despair, for they saw', 'starvation and death in the fields.', 'A few knelt to pray. Others gathered round and joined them, weeping.', 'More left their useless struggles and knelt beside their neighbours. At', 'last nearly all the people were kneeling on the desolate fields praying', 'for deliverance from the plague of crickets.', 'Suddenly, from far off in the air toward the great salt lake, there was', 'the sound of flapping wings. It grew louder. Some of the people looked', 'up, startled. They saw, like a white cloud rising from the lake, a flock', 'of sea gulls flying toward them. Snow-white in the sun, with great wings', 'beating and soaring, in hundreds and hundreds, they rose and circled and', 'came on.', '\"The gulls! the gulls!\" was the cry. \"What does it mean?\"', 'The gulls flew overhead, with a shrill chorus of whimpering cries, and', 'then, in a marvellous white cloud of outspread wings and hovering', 'breasts, they settled down over the cultivated ground.', '\"Oh! woe! woe!\" cried the people. \"The gulls are eating what the', 'crickets have left! they will strip root and branch!\"', 'But all at once, someone called out,--', '\"No, no! See! they are eating the crickets! They are eating only the', 'crickets!\"', 'It was true. The gulls devoured the crickets in dozens, in hundreds, in', 'swarms. They ate until they were gorged, and then they flew heavily back', 'to the lake, only to come again with new appetite. And when at last they', 'finished, they had stripped the fields of the army of crickets; and the', 'people were saved.', 'To this day, in the beautiful city of Salt Lake, which grew out of that', 'pioneer village, the little children are taught to love the sea gulls.', 'And when they learn drawing and weaving in the schools, their first', 'design is often a picture of a cricket and a gull.', 'THE NIGHTINGALE', 'A long, long time ago, as long ago as when there were fairies, there', 'lived an emperor in China, who had a most beautiful palace, all made of', 'crystal.

And, you know, emperors do not cry at all easily. So he', 'asked her to sing again, and this time she sang so marvellously that', 'the tears came out of his eyes and ran down his cheeks. That was a great', 'success. They asked the little Nightingale to sing, over and over again,', 'and when they had listened enough the Emperor said that she should be', 'made \"Singer in Chief to the Court.\" She was to have a golden perch near', \"the Emperor's bed, and a little golden cage, and was to be allowed to go\", 'out twice every day. But there were twelve servants appointed to wait on', 'her, and those twelve servants went with her every time she went out,', 'and each of the twelve had hold of the end of a silken string which was', \"tied to the little Nightingale's leg! It was not so very much fun to go\", 'out that way!', 'For a long, long time the Nightingale sang every evening to the Emperor', 'and his court, and they liked her so much that the ladies all tried to', 'sing like her; they used to put water in their mouths and then make', 'little sounds like this: _glu-glu-glug_. And when the courtiers met each', 'other in the halls, one would say \"Night,\" and the other would say', '\"ingale,\" and that was supposed to be conversation.', 'At last, one day, there came a little package to the Emperor, on the', 'outside of which was written, \"The Nightingale.\" Inside was an', 'artificial bird, something like a Nightingale, only it was made of gold,', 'and silver, and rubies, and emeralds, and diamonds. When it was wound', 'up it played a waltz tune, and as it played it moved its little tail up', 'and down. Everybody in the court was filled with delight at the music of', 'the new nightingale. They made it sing that same tune thirty-three', 'times, and still they had not had enough. They would have made it sing', 'the tune thirty-four times, but the Emperor said, \"I should like to hear', 'the real Nightingale sing, now.\"', 'But when they looked about for the real little Nightingale, they could', 'not find her anywhere!

The best they could do was to', 'patch the gold nightingale up so that it could sing once a year; even', 'that was almost too much, and the tune was very shaky. Still, the', 'Emperor kept the gold nightingale on the perch in his own room.', 'A long time went by, and then, at last, the Emperor grew very ill, and', 'was about to die. When it was sure that he could not live much longer,', 'the people chose a new emperor and waited for the old one to die.

He', 'opened his eyes, and there was Death, sitting on his heart. Death had', \"put on the Emperor's gold crown, and he had the gold sceptre in one\", 'hand, and the silken banner in the other; and he looked at the Emperor', 'with his great hollow eyes. The room was full of shadows, and the', 'shadows were full of faces. Everywhere the Emperor looked, there were', 'faces. Some were very, very ugly, and some were sweet and lovely; they', 'were all the things the Emperor had done in his life, good and bad. And', 'as he looked at them they began to whisper. They whispered, \"_Do you', 'remember this?_\" \"_Do you remember that?_\" The Emperor remembered so', 'much that he cried out loud, \"Oh, bring the great drum!

I have given you gifts of gold and jewels, and kept', 'you always by my side; will you not help me now?\" But there was nobody', 'to wind the little gold nightingale up, and of course it could not sing.', \"The Emperor's heart grew colder and colder where Death crouched upon it,\", \"and the dreadful whispers grew louder and louder, and the Emperor's life\", 'was almost gone. Suddenly, through the open window, there came a most', 'lovely song. It was so sweet and so loud that the whispers died quite', 'away. Presently the Emperor felt his heart grow warm, then he felt the', 'blood flow through his limbs again; he listened to the song until the', 'tears ran down his cheeks; he knew that it was the little real', 'Nightingale who had flown away from him when the gold nightingale came.', 'Death was listening to the song, too; and when it was done and the', 'Emperor begged for more, Death, too, said, \"Please sing again, little', 'Nightingale!\"', '\"Will you give me the Emperor\\'s gold crown for a song?\" said the little', 'Nightingale.', '\"Yes,\" said Death; and the little Nightingale bought the Emperor\\'s crown', 'for a song.', '\"Oh, sing again, little Nightingale,\" begged Death.', '\"Will you give me the Emperor\\'s sceptre for another song?\" said the', 'little grey Nightingale.', '\"Yes,\" said Death; and the little Nightingale bought the Emperor\\'s', 'sceptre for another song.', 'Once more Death begged for a song, and this time the little Nightingale', 'obtained the banner for her singing. Then she sang one more song, so', 'sweet and so sad that it made Death think of his garden in the', 'churchyard, where he always liked best to be. And he rose from the', \"Emperor's heart and floated away through the window.\", 'When Death was gone, the Emperor said to the little Nightingale, \"Oh,', 'dear little Nightingale, you have saved me from Death!

Stay with me on this little gold perch, and sing to me always!\"', '\"No, dear Emperor,\" said the little Nightingale, \"I sing best when I am', 'free; I cannot live in a palace. But every night when you are quite', 'alone, I will come and sit in the window and sing to you, and tell you', 'everything that goes on in your kingdom: I will tell you where the poor', 'people are who ought to be helped, and where the wicked people are who', 'ought to be punished. Only, dear Emperor, be sure that you never let', 'anybody know that you have a little bird who tells you everything.\"', 'After the little Nightingale had flown away, the Emperor felt so well', 'and strong that he dressed himself in his royal robes and took his gold', 'sceptre in his hand. And when the courtiers came in to see if he were', 'dead, there stood the Emperor with his sword in one hand and his sceptre', 'in the other, and said, \"Good-morning!\"', \"MARGERY'S GARDEN\", 'There was once a little girl named Margery, who had always lived in the', 'city. The flat where her mother and father lived was at the top of a big', \"building, and you couldn't see a great deal from the windows, except\", \"chimney-pots on other people's roofs. Margery did not know much about\", 'trees and flowers, but she loved them dearly; whenever it was a fine', 'Sunday she used to go with her mother and father to the park and look at', 'the lovely flower-beds. They seemed always to be finished, though, and', 'Margery was always wishing she could see them grow.', 'One spring, when Margery was nine, her father obtained a new situation', 'and they removed to a little house with a nice big piece of ground a', 'short distance outside the town where his new position was. Margery was', 'delighted. And the very first thing she said, when her father told her', 'about it, was, \"Oh, may I have a garden? _May_ I have a garden?\"', \"Margery's mother was almost as eager for a garden as she was, and\", \"Margery's father said he expected to live on their vegetables all the\", 'rest of his life! So it was soon agreed that the garden should be the', 'first thing attended to.', 'Behind the cottage were apple trees, a plum tree, and two or three pear', 'trees; then came a stretch of rough grass, and then a stone wall, with a', 'gate leading into the fields. It was on the grass plot that the garden', 'was to be. A big piece was to be used for wheat and peas and beans, and', 'a little piece at the end was to be given to Margery.', '\"What shall we have in it?\" asked her mother.', '\"Flowers,\" said Margery, with shining eyes,--\"blue, and white, and', 'yellow, and pink,--every kind of flower!\"', '\"Surely, flowers,\" said her mother, \"and shall we not have a little', 'salad garden in the middle?\"', '\"What is a salad garden?\" Margery asked.', '\"It is a garden where you have all the things that make nice salad,\"', 'said her mother, laughing, for Margery was fond of salads; \"you have', 'lettuce, and endive, and mustard and cress, and parsley, and radishes,', 'and beetroot, and young onions.\"', '\"Oh! how good it sounds!\" said Margery. \"I should love a salad garden.\"', \"That very evening, Margery's father took pencil and paper, and drew out\", 'a plan for her garden; first, they talked it all over, then he drew what', 'they decided on; it looked like the diagram on the next page.', '\"The outside strip is for flowers,\" said Margery\\'s father, \"and next is', 'a footpath, all the way round the beds; that is to let you get at the', 'flowers to weed and to pick; there is a wider path through the middle,', 'and the rest is for rows of salad vegetables.\"', '\"Papa, it is glorious!\" said Margery.', 'Papa laughed. \"I hope you will still think it glorious when the weeding', 'time comes,\" he said, \"for you know, you and mother have promised to', 'take care of this garden, while I take care of the big one.\"', '\"I wouldn\\'t _not_ take care of it for anything!\" said Margery. \"I want', 'to feel that it is my very own.\"', '[Illustration]', 'Her father kissed her, and said it was certainly her \"very own.\"', 'Two evenings after that, when Margery was called in from her first', 'ramble in the fields, she found the postman at the door.', '\"Something for you, Margery,\" said her mother, with the look she had', 'when something nice was happening.', 'It was a box, quite a big box, with a label on it that said:--', '     MISS MARGERY BROWN,', '         PRIMROSE COTTAGE,', '               21 NARCISSUS ROAD,', '                     COLCHESTER.', '     From Seeds and Plants Company, Reading.', 'Margery could hardly wait to open it. It was filled with little', 'packages, all with printed labels; and in the packages, of course, were', 'seeds. It made Margery dance, just to read the names,--nasturtium, giant', 'helianthus, canariensis, calendula, Canterbury bells: more names than I', 'can tell you; and other packages, bigger, that said, \"Sweet Peas,\"', '\"French beans,\" \"Carrots,\" \"Wallflowers,\" and such things! Margery could', 'almost smell the posies, she was so excited. Only, she had seen so', 'little of flowers that she did not know what all the names meant. She', 'did not know that a helianthus was a sunflower until her mother told her', 'so, and she had never seen the dear, blue, bell-shaped flowers that', 'always grow in old-fashioned gardens, and are called Canterbury bells.', 'She thought the calendula must be a strange, grand flower, by its name;', 'but her mother told her it was the gay, sturdy, everydayish little', 'flower called a marigold. There was a great deal for a little city girl', 'to be surprised about, and it did seem as if morning was a long way off!', '\"Did you think you could plant them in the morning?\" asked her mother.', '\"You know, dear, the ground has to be made ready first; it takes a', 'little time,--it may be several days before you can plant.\"', 'That was another surprise. Margery had thought she could begin to sow', 'the seed right off.', 'But this was what had happened. Early the next morning, a man came', 'driving up to the cottage with two strong white horses; in his wagon was', 'a plough. I suppose you have seen ploughs, but Margery never had, and', 'she watched with great interest, while the man and her father took the', 'plough from the cart and harnessed the horses to it. It was a great,', 'three-cornered piece of sharp steel, with long handles coming up from', 'it, so that a man could hold it in place. It looked like this:--', '[Illustration]', '\"I brought a two-horse plough because it\\'s virgin soil,\" the man said.', 'Margery wondered what in the world he meant; it had not been', 'cultivated, of course, but what had that do with the kind of plough?', '\"What does he mean, father?\" she whispered, when she got a chance. \"He', 'means that this land has not been ploughed before; it will be hard to', 'turn the soil, and one horse could not pull the plough,\" said her', 'father.', 'It took the man two hours to plough the little strip of land. He drove', 'the sharp end of the plough into the soil, and held it firmly so, while', 'the horses drew it along in a straight line. Margery found it', 'fascinating to watch the long line of dark earth and green grass come', 'rolling up and turn over, as the knife passed it. She could see that it', 'took real skill and strength to keep the line even, and to avoid the', 'stones. Sometimes the plough struck a hidden stone, and then the man was', 'jerked almost off his feet. But he only laughed, and said, \"Tough piece', 'of land; it will be a lot better next year.\"', 'When he had ploughed, the man went back to his cart and unloaded another', 'farm implement. This one was like a three-cornered platform of wood,', 'with a long, curved, strong rake under it. It was called a harrow, and', 'it looked like the diagram on the next page.', 'The man harnessed the horses to it, and then he stood on the platform', 'and drove all over the strip of land. It was fun to watch, but perhaps', \"it was a little hard to do. The man's weight kept the harrow steady,\", 'and let the teeth of the rake scratch and cut the ground up, so that it', 'did not stay in ridges.', '\"He scrambles the ground, father!\" said Margery.', '\"It needs \\'scrambling,\\'\" laughed her father. \"We are going to get more', 'weeds than we want on this fresh soil, and the more the ground is', 'broken, the fewer there will be.\"', '[Illustration]', \"After the ploughing and harrowing, the man drove off, and Margery's\", 'father said that he himself would do the rest of the work in the late', 'afternoons, when he came home from business; they could not afford too', 'much help, he said, and he had learned to take care of a garden when he', 'was a boy. So Margery did not see any more done until the next day.', \"But the next day there was hard work for Margery's father! Every bit of\", 'that ground had to be broken up still more with a spade, and then the', 'clods which were full of grass-roots had to be taken on a fork and', 'shaken, till the earth fell out; when the grass was thrown to one side.', 'That would not have had to be done if the land had been ploughed in the', 'autumn; the grass would have rotted in the ground, and would have made', \"food for the plants. Now, Margery's father put the fertiliser on the\", 'top, and then raked it into the earth.', 'At last, it was time to make the place for the seeds. Margery and her', 'mother helped. Father tied one end of a cord to a little stake, and', 'drove the stake in the ground at one end of the garden. Then he took the', 'cord to the other end of the garden and pulled it tight, tied it to', 'another stake, and drove that down. That made a straight line. Then he', 'hoed a trench, a few inches deep, the whole length of the cord, and', 'scattered fertiliser in it. Pretty soon the whole garden was lined with', 'little trenches.', '\"Now for the seed,\" said father.', 'Margery ran and brought the seed box. \"May I help?\" she asked.', '\"If you watch me sow one row, I think you can do the next,\" said her', 'father.', 'So Margery watched. Her father took a handful of peas, and, stooping,', 'walked slowly along the line, letting the seed trickle through his', 'fingers. It was pretty to watch; it made Margery think of a photograph', 'her teacher had, a photograph of a famous picture called \"The Sower.\"', 'Perhaps you have seen it.', 'Putting in the seed was not so easy to do as to watch; sometimes Margery', 'dropped in too much, and sometimes not enough; but her father was', 'patient with her, and soon she did better.', \"They planted peas, beans, spinach, carrots, and parsnips. And Margery's\", 'father made a row of holes, after that, for the tomato plants. He said', 'those had to be transplanted; they could not be sown from seed.', 'When the seeds were in the trenches they had to be covered up, and', 'Margery really helped at that. It is fun to do it. You stand beside the', 'little trench and walk backward, and as you walk you hoe the loose earth', 'back over the seeds; the same earth that was hoed up you pull back', 'again. Then you rake very gently over the surface, with the back of a', 'rake, to even it all off. Margery liked it, because now the garden began', 'to look _like_ a garden.', 'But best of all was the work next day, when her own little particular', \"garden was begun. Father Brown loved Margery and Margery's mother so\", 'much that he wanted their garden to be perfect, and that meant a great', 'deal more work. He knew very well that the old grass would begin to come', 'through again on such soil, and that it would make terribly hard', 'weeding. He was not going to have any such thing for his two \"little', 'girls,\" as he called them. So he gave that little garden particular', 'attention. This is what he did.', 'After he had thrown out all the turf, he shovelled clean earth on to the', 'garden,--as much as three solid inches of it; not a bit of grass was in', 'that. Then it was ready for raking and fertilising, and for the lines.', \"The little footpaths were marked out by Father Brown's feet; Margery and\", 'her mother laughed well at his actions, for it looked like some kind of', 'dance. Mr Brown had seen gardeners do it when he was a little boy, and', 'he did it very nicely: he walked along the sides of the square, with one', 'foot turned a little out, and the other straight, taking such tiny steps', 'that his feet touched each other all the time. This tramped out a path', 'just wide enough for a person to walk.', 'The wider path was marked with lines and raked.', 'Margery thought, of course, all the flowers would be put in as the', 'vegetables were; but she found that it was not so. For some, her father', 'poked little holes with his finger; for some, he made very shallow', 'trenches; and some very small seeds were scattered lightly over the top', 'of the ground.', 'Margery and her mother had taken so much pains in thinking out the', 'arrangement of the flowers, that perhaps you will like to hear just how', 'they designed that garden. At the back were the sweet peas, which would', 'grow tall, like a screen; on the two sides, for a kind of hedge, were', 'yellow sunflowers; and along the front edge were the gay nasturtiums.', 'Margery planned that, so that she could look into the garden from the', 'front, but have it shut away from the vegetable patch by the tall', 'flowers on the sides. The two front corners had canariensis in them.', 'Canariensis is a pretty creeper with golden blossoms, very dainty and', 'bright. And then, in little square patches all round the garden, were', \"planted London pride, blue bachelor's buttons, yellow marigolds, tall\", 'larkspur, many-coloured asters, hollyhocks and stocks. All these lovely', \"flowers used to grow in our grandmothers' gardens, and if you don't know\", 'what they look like, I hope you can find out next summer.', 'Between the flowers and the middle path went the seeds for that', 'wonderful salad garden; all the things Mrs Brown had named to Margery', 'were there. Margery had never seen anything more wonderful than the', 'little round lettuce-seeds. They were so tiny that it did not seem', 'possible that green lettuce leaves could come from them. But they surely', 'would.', 'Mother and father and Margery were late to supper that evening. But they', 'were all so happy that it did not matter. The last thing Margery', 'thought of, as she went to sleep at night, was the dear, smooth little', 'garden, with its funny footpath, and with the little sticks standing at', 'the ends of the rows, labelled \"lettuce,\" \"beets,\" \"helianthus,\" and so', 'on.', '\"I have a garden! I have a garden!\" was Margery\\'s last thought as she', 'went off to dreamland.', 'THE LITTLE COTYLEDONS', \"This is another story about Margery's garden.\", 'The next morning after the garden was planted, Margery was up and out at', \"six o'clock. She could not wait to look at her garden. To be sure, she\", 'knew that the seeds could not sprout in a single night, but she had a', 'feeling that _something_ might happen at any moment. The garden was just', 'as smooth and brown as the night before, and no little seedlings were in', 'sight.', 'But a very few mornings after that, when Margery went out, she saw a', 'funny little crack opening up through the earth, the whole length of the', 'patch. Quickly she knelt down on the footpath, to see. Yes! Tiny green', 'leaves, a whole row of them, were pushing their way through the crust!', 'Margery knew what she had put there: it was the radish-row; these must', 'be radish leaves. She examined them very closely, so that she might', 'know a radish next time. The little leaves, no bigger than half your', 'little-finger nail, grew in twos,--two on each tiny stem; they were', 'almost round.', 'Margery flew back to her mother, to say that the first seeds were up.', 'And her mother, nearly as excited as Margery, came to look at the little', 'crack.', 'Each day, after that, the row of radishes grew, till, in a week, it', 'stood as high as your finger, green and sturdy. But about the third day,', 'while Margery was stooping over the radishes, she saw something very,', 'very small and green, peeping above ground, where the lettuce was', 'planted. Could it be weeds? No, for on looking very closely she saw that', 'the wee leaves faintly marked a regular row. They did not make a crack,', 'like the radishes; they seemed too small and too far apart to push the', 'earth up like that. Margery leaned down and looked with all her eyes at', 'the baby plants. The tiny leaves grew two on a stem, and were almost', 'round. The more she looked at them the more it seemed to Margery that', 'they looked exactly as the radish looked when it first came up. \"Do you', 'suppose,\" Margery said to herself, \"that lettuce and radish look alike', \"while they are growing? They don't look alike when they are on the\", 'table!\"', 'Day by day the lettuce grew, and soon the little round leaves were', 'easier to examine; they certainly were very much like radish leaves.', 'Then, one morning, while she was searching for signs of other seeds,', 'Margery discovered the beets. In irregular patches on the row, hints of', 'green were coming. The next day and the next they grew, until the beet', 'leaves were big enough to see.', 'Margery looked. Then she looked again. Then she wrinkled her forehead.', '\"Can we have made a mistake?\" she thought. \"Do you suppose we can have', 'planted _all_ radishes?\"', 'For those little beet leaves were almost round, and they grew two on a', 'stem, precisely like the lettuce and the radish; except for the size,', 'all three rows looked alike.', 'It was too much for Margery. She ran to the house and found her father.', 'Her little face was so anxious that he thought something unpleasant had', 'happened. \"Papa,\" she said, all out of breath, \"do you think we could', 'have made a mistake about my garden? Do you think we could have put', 'radishes in all the rows?\"', 'Father laughed. \"What makes you think such a thing?\" he asked.', '\"Papa,\" said Margery, \"the little leaves all look exactly alike! every', 'plant has just two tiny leaves on it, and shaped the same; they are', 'roundish, and grow out of the stem at the same place.\"', 'Papa\\'s eyes began to twinkle. \"Many of the dicotyledonous plants look', 'alike at the beginning,\" he said, with a little drawl on the big word.', 'That was to tease Margery, because she always wanted to know the big', 'words she heard.', '\"What\\'s \\'dicotyledonous\\'?\" said Margery, carefully.', '\"Wait till I come home to-night, dear,\" said her father, \"and I\\'ll tell', 'you.\"', 'That evening Margery was waiting eagerly for him. When her father', 'finished his supper they went together to the garden, and father', 'examined the seedlings carefully. Then he pulled up a little radish', 'plant and a tiny beet.', '\"These little leaves,\" he said, \"are not the real leaves of the plant;', 'they are only little pockets to hold food for the plant to live on till', 'it gets strong enough to push up into the air. As soon as the real', 'leaves come out and begin to draw food from the air, these little', 'substitutes wither up and fall off. These two lie folded up in the', \"little seed from the beginning, and are full of plant food. They don't\", \"have to be very special in shape, you see, because they don't stay on\", 'the plant after it is grown up.\"', '\"Then every plant looks like this at first?\" said Margery.', '\"No, dear, not every one; plants are divided into two kinds: those which', 'have two food leaves, like these plants, and those which have only one;', 'these are called dicotyledonous, and the ones which have but one food', 'leaf are monocotyledonous. Many of the dicotyledons look alike.\"', '\"I think that is interesting,\" said Margery.', '\"I always, supposed the plants were different from the minute they began', 'to grow.\"', '\"Indeed, no,\" said father. \"Even some of the trees look like this when', 'they first come through; you would not think a birch tree could look', 'like a vegetable or a flower, would you? But it does, at first; it looks', 'so much like these things that in the great nurseries, where trees are', 'raised for forests and parks, the workmen have to be very carefully', 'trained, or else they would pull up the trees when they are weeding.', 'They have to be taught the difference between a birch tree and a weed.\"', '\"How funny!\" said Margery, dimpling.', '\"Yes, it sounds funny,\" said father; \"but, you see, the birch tree is', 'dicotyledonous, and so are many weeds, and the dicotyledons look so much', 'alike at first.\"', '\"I am glad to know that, father,\" said Margery, soberly. \"I believe I', 'shall learn a good deal from living in the country; don\\'t you think so?\"', 'Margery\\'s father took her in his arms. \"I hope so, dear,\" he said; \"the', 'country is a good place for little girls.\"', 'And that was all that happened, that day.', 'THE TALKATIVE TORTOISE', 'Once upon a time, a Tortoise lived in a pond with two Ducks, who were', 'her very good friends. She enjoyed the company of the Ducks, because she', \"could talk with them to her heart's content; the Tortoise liked to talk.\", 'She always had something to say, and she liked to hear herself say it.', 'After many years of this pleasant living, the pond became very low, in a', 'dry season; and finally it dried up. The two Ducks saw that they could', 'no longer live there, so they decided to fly to another region, where', 'there was more water. They went to the Tortoise to bid her good-bye.', '\"Oh, don\\'t leave me behind!\" begged the Tortoise. \"Take me with you; I', 'must die if I am left here.\"', '\"But you cannot fly!\" said the Ducks. \"How can we take you with us?\"', '\"Take me with you! take me with you!\" said the Tortoise.', 'The Ducks felt so sorry for her that at last they thought of a way to', 'take her. \"We have thought of a way which will be possible,\" they said,', '\"if only you can manage to keep still long enough. We will each take', 'hold of one end of a stout stick, and do you take the middle in your', 'mouth; then we will fly up in the air with you and carry you with us.', 'But remember not to talk! If you open your mouth, you are lost.\"', 'The Tortoise said she would not say a word; she would not so much as', 'move her mouth; and she was very grateful. So the Ducks brought a strong', 'little stick and took hold of the ends, while the Tortoise bit firmly on', 'the middle. Then the two Ducks rose slowly in the air and flew away with', 'their burden.', 'When they were above the treetops, the Tortoise wanted to say, \"How high', 'we are!\" But she remembered, and kept still. When they passed the church', 'steeple she wanted to say, \"What is that which shines?\" But she', 'remembered, and held her peace. Then they came over the village square,', 'and the people looked up and saw them. \"Look at the Ducks carrying a', 'Tortoise!\" they shouted; and every one ran to look. The Tortoise wanted', 'to say, \"What business is it of yours?\" But she didn\\'t. Then she heard', 'the people shout, \"Isn\\'t it strange! Look at it! Look!\"', 'The Tortoise forgot everything except that she wanted to say, \"Hush, you', 'foolish people!\" She opened her mouth,--and fell to the ground. And that', 'was the end of the Tortoise.', \"It is a very good thing to be able to hold one's tongue!\", 'ROBERT OF SICILY', 'An old legend says that there was once a king named Robert of Sicily,', 'who was brother to the Great Pope of Rome and to the Emperor of', 'Allemaine. He was a very selfish king, and very proud; he cared more for', 'his pleasures than for the needs of his people, and his heart was so', 'filled with his own greatness that he had no thought for God.', 'One day, this proud king was sitting in his place at church, at vesper', 'service; his courtiers were about him, in their bright garments, and he', 'himself was dressed in his royal robes. The choir was chanting the Latin', 'service, and as the beautiful voices swelled louder, the king noticed', 'one particular verse which seemed to be repeated again and again. He', 'turned to a learned clerk at his side and asked what those words meant,', 'for he knew no Latin.', '\"They mean, \\'He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and hath', 'exalted them of low degree,\\'\" answered the clerk.', '\"It is well the words are in Latin, then,\" said the king angrily, \"for', 'they are a lie. There is no power on earth or in heaven which can put me', 'down from my seat!\" and he sneered at the beautiful singing, as he', 'leaned back in his place.', 'Presently the king fell asleep, while the service went on. He slept', 'deeply and long. When he awoke the church was dark and still, and he was', 'all alone. He, the king, had been left alone in the church, to awake in', 'the dark! He was furious with rage and surprise, and, stumbling through', 'the dim aisles, he reached the great doors and beat at them, madly,', 'shouting for his servants.', 'The old sexton heard some one shouting and pounding in the church, and', 'thought it was some drunken vagabond who had stolen in during the', 'service. He came to the door with his keys and called out, \"Who is', 'there?\"', '\"Open! open! It is I, the king!\" came a hoarse, angry voice from within.', '\"It is a crazy man,\" thought the sexton; and he was frightened. He', 'opened the doors carefully and stood back, peering into the darkness.', 'Out past him rushed the figure of a man in tattered, scanty clothes,', 'with unkempt hair and white, wild face. The sexton did not know that he', 'had ever seen him before, but he looked long after him, wondering at his', 'wildness and his haste.', 'In his fluttering rags, without hat or cloak, not knowing what strange', 'thing had happened to him, King Robert rushed to his palace gates,', 'pushed aside the startled servants, and hurried, blind with rage, up the', 'wide stair and through the great corridors, toward the room where he', \"could hear the sound of his courtiers' voices. Men and women servants\", 'tried to stop the ragged man, who had somehow got into the palace, but', 'Robert did not even see them as he fled along. Straight to the open', 'doors of the big banquet hall he made his way, and into the midst of the', 'grand feast there.', 'The great hall was filled with lights and flowers; the tables were set', 'with everything that is delicate and rich to eat; the courtiers, in', 'their gay clothes, were laughing and talking; and at the head of the', \"feast, on the king's own throne, sat a king. His face, his figure, his\", 'voice were exactly like Robert of Sicily; no human being could have told', 'the difference; no one dreamed that he was not the king. He was dressed', \"in the king's royal robes, he wore the royal crown, and on his hand was\", \"the king's own ring. Robert of Sicily, half naked, ragged, without a\", 'sign of his kingship on him, stood before the throne and stared with', 'fury at this figure of himself.', 'The king on the throne looked at him. \"Who art thou, and what dost thou', 'here?\" he asked. And though his voice was just like Robert\\'s own, it had', 'something in it sweet and deep, like the sound of bells.', '\"I am the king!\" cried Robert of Sicily. \"I am the king, and you are an', 'impostor!\"', 'The courtiers started from their seats, and drew their swords. They', 'would have killed the crazy man who insulted their king; but he raised', \"his hand and stopped them, and with his eyes looking into Robert's eyes\", 'he said, \"Not the king; you shall be the king\\'s jester! You shall wear', 'the cap and bells, and make laughter for my court. You shall be the', 'servant of the servants, and your companion shall, be the jester\\'s ape.\"', 'With shouts of laughter, the courtiers drove Robert of Sicily from the', 'banquet hall; the waiting-men, with laughter, too, pushed him into the', \"soldiers' hall; and there the pages brought the jester's wretched ape,\", \"and put a fool's cap and bells on Robert's head. It was like a terrible\", 'dream; he could not believe it true, he could not understand what had', 'happened to him. And when he woke next morning, he believed it was a', 'dream, and that he was king again. But as he turned his head, he felt', 'the coarse straw under his cheek instead of the soft pillow, and he saw', 'that he was in the stable, with the shivering ape by his side. Robert of', 'Sicily was a jester, and no one knew him for the king.', 'Three long years passed. Sicily was happy and all things went well under', 'the king, who was not Robert. Robert was still the jester, and his heart', 'grew harder and more bitter with every year. Many times, during the', 'three years, the king, who had his face and voice, had called him to', 'himself, when none else could hear, and had asked him the one question,', '\"Who art thou?\" And each time that he asked it his eyes looked into', \"Robert's eyes, to find his heart. But each time Robert threw back his\", 'head and answered, proudly, \"I am the king!\" And the other king\\'s eyes', 'grew sad and stern.', 'At the end of three years, the Pope called the Emperor of Allemaine and', 'the King of Sicily, his brothers, to a great meeting in his city of', 'Rome. The King of Sicily went, with all his soldiers and courtiers and', 'servants,--a great procession of horsemen and footmen. Never had there', 'been seen a finer sight than the grand train, men in bright armour,', 'riders in wonderful cloaks of velvet and silk, servants, carrying', 'marvellous presents to the Pope. And at the very end rode Robert, the', 'jester. His horse was poor and old, many-coloured, and the ape rode with', 'him. Every one in the villages through which they passed ran after the', 'jester, and pointed and laughed.', 'The Pope received his brothers and their trains in the square before', \"Saint Peter's. With music and flags and flowers he made the King of\", 'Sicily welcome, and greeted him as his brother. In the midst of it, the', 'jester broke through the crowd and threw himself before the Pope. \"Look', 'at me!\" he cried; \"I am your brother, Robert of Sicily! This man is an', 'impostor, who has stolen my throne. I am Robert, the king!\"', 'The Pope looked at the poor jester with pity, but the Emperor of', 'Allemaine turned to the King of Sicily, and said, \"Is it not rather', 'dangerous, brother, to keep a madman as jester?\" And again Robert was', 'pushed back among the serving-men.', 'It was Holy Week, and the king and the emperor, with all their trains,', 'went every day to the great services in the cathedral. Something', 'wonderful and holy seemed to make these services more beautiful than', 'ever before. All the people of Rome felt it: it was as if the presence', 'of an angel were there. Men thought of God, and felt His blessing on', 'them. But no one knew who it was that brought the beautiful feeling. And', 'when Easter Day came, never had there been so lovely, so holy a day: in', 'the great churches, filled with flowers, and sweet with incense, the', 'kneeling people listened to the choirs singing, and it was like the', 'voices of angels; their prayers were more earnest than ever before,', 'their praise more glad; there was something heavenly in Rome.', 'Robert of Sicily went to the services with the rest, and sat in the', 'humblest place with the servants. Over and over again he heard the', 'sweet voices of the choirs chant the Latin words he had heard long ago:', '_He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted them of', 'low degree_. And at last, as he listened, his heart was softened. He,', 'too, felt the strange blessed presence of a heavenly power. He thought', 'of God, and of his own wickedness; he remembered how selfish he had', 'been, and how little good he had done; he realised, that his power had', 'not been from himself, at all. On Easter night, as he crept to his bed', 'of straw, he wept, not because he was so wretched, but because he had', 'not been a better king when power was his.', 'At last all the festivities were over, and the King of Sicily went home', 'to his own land again, with his people. Robert the jester came home too.', 'On the day of their home-coming, there was a special service in the', 'royal church, and even after the service was over for the people, the', 'monks held prayers of thanksgiving and praise. The sound of their', 'singing came softly in at the palace windows. In the great banquet room,', 'the king sat, wearing his royal robes and his crown, while many subjects', 'came to greet him. At last, he sent them all away, saying he wanted to', 'be alone; but he commanded the jester to stay. And when they were alone', \"together the king looked into Robert's eyes, as he had done before, and\", 'said, softly, \"Who art thou?\"', 'Robert of Sicily bowed his head. \"Thou knowest best,\" he said, \"I only', 'know that I have sinned.\"', 'As he spoke, he heard the voices of the monks singing, _He hath put down', 'the mighty from their seat_,--and his head sank lower. But suddenly the', 'music seemed to change; a wonderful light shone all about. As Robert', 'raised his eyes, he saw the face of the king smiling at him with a', 'radiance like nothing on earth, and as he sank to his knees before the', 'glory of that smile, a voice sounded with the music, like a melody', 'throbbing on a single string,--', '\"I am an angel, and thou art the king!\"', 'Then Robert of Sicily was alone. His royal robes were upon him once', 'more; he wore his crown and his royal ring. He was king. And when the', 'courtiers came back they found their king kneeling by his throne,', 'absorbed in silent prayer.', 'THE JEALOUS COURTIERS', 'I wonder if you have ever heard the anecdote about the artist of', 'Duesseldorf and the jealous courtiers. This is it. It seems there was', 'once a very famous artist who lived in the little town of Duesseldorf. He', 'did such fine work that the Elector, Prince Johann Wilhelm, ordered a', 'portrait statue of himself, on horseback, to be done in bronze. The', 'artist was overjoyed at the commission, and worked early and late at the', 'statue.', 'At last the work was done, and the artist had the great statue set up in', 'the public square of Duesseldorf, ready for the opening view. The Elector', 'came on the appointed day, and with him came his favourite courtiers', 'from the castle. Then the statue was unveiled. It was very', 'beautiful,--so beautiful that the prince exclaimed in surprise. He could', 'not look enough, and presently he turned to the artist and shook hands', 'with him, like an old friend. \"Herr Grupello,\" he said, \"you are a great', 'artist, and this statue will make your fame even greater than it is; the', 'portrait of me is perfect!\"', 'When the courtiers heard this, and saw the friendly hand-shake, their', 'jealousy of the artist was beyond bounds. Their one thought was, how', 'could they safely do something to humiliate him. They dared not pick', 'flaws in the portrait statue, for the prince had declared it perfect.', 'But at last one of them said, with an air of great frankness, \"Indeed,', 'Herr Grupello, the portrait of his Royal Highness is perfect; but permit', 'me to say that the statue of the horse is not quite so successful: the', 'head is too large; it is out of proportion.\"', '\"No,\" said another, \"the horse is really not so successful; the turn of', 'the neck, there, is awkward.\"', '\"If you would change the right hind-foot, Herr Grupello,\" said a third,', '\"it would be an improvement.\"', \"Still another found fault with the horse's tail.\", 'The artist listened, quietly. When they had all finished, he turned to', 'the prince and said, \"Your courtiers, prince, find a good many flaws in', 'the statue of the horse; will you permit me to keep it a few days more,', 'to do what I can with it?\"', 'The Elector assented, and the artist ordered a temporary screen to be', 'built around the statue, so that his assistants could work undisturbed.', 'For several days the sound of hammering came steadily from behind the', 'enclosure. The courtiers, who took care to pass that way, often, were', 'delighted. Each one said to himself, \"I must have been right, really;', 'the artist himself sees that something was wrong; now I shall have', 'credit for saving the prince\\'s portrait by my artistic taste!\"', 'Once more the artist summoned the prince and his courtiers, and once', 'more the statue was unveiled. Again the Elector exclaimed at its beauty,', 'and then he turned to his courtiers, one after another, to see what they', 'had to say.', '\"Perfect!\" said the first. \"Now that the horse\\'s head is in proportion,', 'there is not a flaw.\"', '\"The change in the neck was just what was needed,\" said the second; \"it', 'is very graceful now.\"', '\"The rear right foot is as it should be, now,\" said a third, \"and it', 'adds so much to the beauty of the whole!\"', 'The fourth said that he considered the tail greatly improved.', '\"My courtiers are much pleased now,\" said the prince to Herr Grupello;', '\"they think the statue much improved by the changes you have made.\"', 'Herr Grupello smiled a little. \"I am glad they are pleased,\" he said,', '\"but the fact is, I have changed nothing!\"', '\"What do you mean?\" said the prince in surprise. \"Have we not heard the', 'sound of hammering every day? What were you hammering at then?\"', '\"I was hammering at the reputation of your courtiers, who found fault', 'simply because they were jealous,\" said the artist. \"And I rather think', 'that their reputation is pretty well hammered to pieces!\"', 'It was, indeed. The Elector laughed heartily, but the courtiers slunk', 'away, one after another, without a word.', 'PRINCE CHERRY', 'There was once an old king, so wise and kind and true that the most', 'powerful good fairy of his land visited him and asked him to name the', 'dearest wish of his heart, that she might grant it.', '\"Surely you know it,\" said the good king; \"it is for my only son, Prince', 'Cherry; do for him whatever you would have done for me.\"', '\"Gladly,\" said the great fairy; \"choose what I shall give him. I can', 'make him the richest, the most beautiful, or the most powerful prince in', 'the world; choose.\"', '\"None of those things are what I want,\" said the king. \"I want only that', 'he shall be good. Of what use will it be to him to be beautiful, rich,', 'or powerful, if he grows into a bad man? Make him the best prince in the', 'world, I beg you!\"', '\"Alas, I cannot make him good,\" said the fairy; \"he must do that for', 'himself. I can give him good advice, reprove him when he does wrong, and', 'punish him if he will not punish himself; I can and will be his best', 'friend, but I cannot make him good unless he wills it.\"', 'The king was sad to hear this, but he rejoiced in the friendship of the', 'fairy for his son. And when he died, soon after, he was happy to know', 'that he left Prince Cherry in her hands.', 'Prince Cherry grieved for his father, and often lay awake at night,', 'thinking of him. One night, when he was all alone in his room, a soft', 'and lovely light suddenly shone before him, and a beautiful vision stood', 'at his side. It was the good fairy. She was clad in robes of dazzling', 'white, and on her shining hair she wore a wreath of white roses.', '\"I am the Fairy Candide,\" she said to the prince. \"I promised your', 'father that I would be your best friend, and as long as you live I shall', 'watch over your happiness. I have brought you a gift; it is not', 'wonderful to look at, but it has a wonderful power for your welfare;', 'wear it, and let it help you.\"', \"As she spoke, she placed a small gold ring on the prince's little\", 'finger. \"This ring,\" she said, \"will help you to be good; when you do', 'evil, it will prick you, to remind you. If you do not heed its warnings', 'a worse thing will happen to you, for I shall become your enemy.\" Then', 'she vanished.', \"Prince Cherry wore his ring, and said nothing to anyone of the fairy's\", 'gift. It did not prick him for a long time, because he was good and', 'merry and happy. But Prince Cherry had been rather spoiled by his nurse', 'when he was a child; she had always said to him that when he should', 'become king he could do exactly as he pleased. Now, after a while, he', 'began to find out that this was not true, and it made him angry.', 'The first time that he noticed that even a king could not always have', 'his own way was on a day when he went hunting. It happened that he got', 'no game. This put him in such a bad temper that he grumbled and scolded', 'all the way home. The little gold ring began to feel tight and', 'uncomfortable. When he reached the palace his pet dog ran to meet him.', '\"Go away!\" said the prince, crossly.', 'But the little dog was so used to being petted that he only jumped up on', 'his master, and tried to kiss his hand. The prince turned and kicked the', 'little creature. At the instant, he felt a sharp prick in his little', 'finger, like a pin prick.', '\"What nonsense!\" said the prince to himself. \"Am I not king of the whole', 'land? May I not kick my own dog, if I choose? What evil is there in', 'that?\"', 'A silver voice spoke in his ear: \"The king of the land has a right to do', 'good, but not evil; you have been guilty of bad temper and of cruelty', 'to-day; see that you do better to-morrow.\"', 'The prince turned sharply, but no one was to be seen; yet he recognised', 'the voice as that of Fairy Candide.', 'He followed her advice for a little, but presently he forgot, and the', 'ring pricked him so sharply that his finger had a drop of blood on it.', 'This happened again and again, for the prince grew more self-willed and', 'headstrong every day; he had some bad friends, too, who urged him on, in', 'the hope that he would ruin himself and give them a chance to seize the', 'throne. He treated his people carelessly and his servants cruelly, and', 'everything he wanted he felt that he must have.', 'The ring annoyed him terribly; it was embarrassing for a king to have a', 'drop of blood on his finger all the time! At last he took the ring off', 'and put it out of sight. Then he thought he should be perfectly happy,', 'having his own way; but instead, he grew more unhappy as he grew less', 'good. Whenever he was crossed, or could not have his own way instantly,', 'he flew into a passion.', 'Finally, he wanted something that he really could not have. This time it', 'was a most beautiful young girl, named Zelia; the prince saw her, and', 'loved her so much that he wanted at once to make her his queen. To his', 'great astonishment, she refused.', '\"Am I not pleasing to you?\" asked the prince in surprise.', '\"You are very handsome, very charming, prince,\" said Zelia; \"but you are', 'not like the good king, your father; I fear you would make me very', 'miserable if I were your queen.\"', 'In a great rage, Prince Cherry ordered the young girl to be put in', 'prison; and the key of her dungeon he kept. He told one of his friends,', 'a wicked man who flattered him for his own purposes, about the thing,', 'and asked his advice.', '\"Are you not king?\" said the bad friend. \"May you not do as you will?', 'Keep the girl in a dungeon till she does as you command, and if she will', 'not, sell her as a slave.\"', '\"But would it not be a disgrace for me to harm an innocent creature?\"', 'said the prince.', '\"It would be a disgrace to you to have it said that one of your subjects', 'dared disobey you!\" said the courtier.', \"He had cleverly touched the prince's worst trait, his pride. Prince\", \"Cherry went at once to Zelia's dungeon, prepared to do this cruel thing.\", 'Zelia was gone. No one had the key save the prince himself; yet she was', 'gone. The only person who could have dared to help her, thought the', 'prince, was his old tutor, Suliman, the only man left who ever rebuked', 'him for anything. In fury, he ordered Suliman to be put in fetters and', 'brought before him.', 'As his servants left him, to carry out the wicked order, there was a', 'clash, as of thunder, in the room, and then a blinding light. Fairy', 'Candide stood before him. Her beautiful face was stern, and her silver', 'voice rang like a trumpet, as she said, \"Wicked and selfish prince, you', 'have become baser than the beasts you hunt; you are furious as a lion,', 'revengeful as a serpent, greedy as a wolf, and brutal as a bull; take,', 'therefore, the shape of those beasts whom you resemble!\"', 'With horror, the prince felt himself being transformed into a monster.', 'He tried to rush upon the fairy and kill her, but she had vanished with', 'her words. As he stood, her voice came from the air, saying, sadly,', '\"Learn to conquer your pride by being in submission to your own', 'subjects.\" At the same moment, Prince Cherry felt himself being', 'transported to a distant forest, where he was set down by a clear', 'stream. In the water he saw his own terrible image; he had the head of a', \"lion, with bull's horns, the feet of a wolf, and a tail like a serpent.\", 'And as he gazed in horror, the fairy\\'s voice whispered, \"Your soul has', 'become more ugly than your shape is; you yourself have deformed it.\"', 'The poor beast rushed away from the sound of her words, but in a moment', 'he stumbled into a trap, set by bear-catchers. When the trappers found', 'him they were delighted to have caught a curiosity, and they immediately', 'dragged him to the palace courtyard. There he heard the whole court', 'buzzing with gossip. Prince Cherry had been struck by lightning and', 'killed, was the news, and the five favourite courtiers had struggled to', 'make themselves rulers, but the people had refused them, and offered the', 'crown to Suliman, the good old tutor.', 'Even as he heard this, the prince saw Suliman on the steps of the', 'palace, speaking to the people. \"I will take the crown to keep in', 'trust,\" he said. \"Perhaps the prince is not dead.\"', '\"He was a bad king; we do not want him back,\" said the people.', '\"I know his heart,\" said Suliman, \"it is not all bad; it is tainted, but', 'not corrupt; perhaps he will repent and come back to us a good king.\"', 'When the beast heard this, it touched him so much that he stopped', 'tearing at his chains, and became gentle. He let his keepers lead him', 'away to the royal menagerie without hurting them.', 'Life was very terrible to the prince, now, but he began to see that he', 'had brought all his sorrow on himself, and he tried to bear it', 'patiently. The worst to bear was the cruelty of the keeper. At last, one', 'night, this keeper was in great danger; a tiger got loose, and attacked', 'him. \"Good enough! Let him die!\" thought Prince Cherry. But when he saw', 'how helpless the keeper was, he repented, and sprang to help. He killed', \"the tiger and saved the keeper's life.\", 'As he crouched at the keeper\\'s feet, a voice said, \"Good actions never', 'go unrewarded!\" And the terrible monster was changed into a pretty', 'little white dog.', 'The keeper carried the beautiful little dog to the court and told the', 'story, and from then on, Cherry was carefully treated, and had the best', 'of everything. But in order to keep the little dog from growing, the', 'queen ordered that he should be fed very little, and that was pretty', 'hard for the poor prince. He was often half starved, although so much', 'petted.', 'One day he had carried his crust of bread to a retired spot in the', 'palace woods, where he loved to be, when he saw a poor old woman hunting', 'for roots, and seeming almost starved.', '\"Poor thing,\" he thought, \"she is even more hungry than I\"; and he ran', 'up and dropped the crust at her feet.', 'The woman ate it, and seemed greatly refreshed.', 'Cherry was glad of that, and he was running happily back to his kennel', 'when he heard cries of distress, and suddenly he saw some rough men', 'dragging along a young girl, who was weeping and crying for help. What', 'was his horror to see that the young girl was Zelia! Oh, how he wished', 'he were the monster once more, so that he could kill the men and rescue', 'her! But he could do nothing except bark, and bite at the heels of the', 'wicked men. That did not stop them; they drove him off, with blows, and', 'carried Zelia into a palace in the wood.', 'Poor Cherry crouched by the steps, and watched. His heart was full of', 'pity and rage. But suddenly he thought, \"I was as bad as these men; I', 'myself put Zelia in prison, and would have treated her worse still, if I', 'had not been prevented.\" The thought made him so sorry and ashamed that', 'he repented bitterly the evil he had done.', 'Presently a window opened, and Cherry saw Zelia lean out and throw down', 'a piece of meat. He seized it and was just going to devour it, when the', 'old woman to whom he had given his crust snatched it away and took him', 'in her arms. \"No, you shall not eat it, you poor little thing,\" she', 'said, \"for every bit of food in that house is poisoned.\"', 'At the same moment, a voice said, \"Good actions never go unrewarded!\"', 'And instantly Prince Cherry was transformed into a little white dove.', 'With great joy, he flew to the open palace window to seek out his Zelia,', 'to try to help her. But though he hunted in every room, no Zelia was to', 'be found. He had to fly away, without seeing her. He wanted more than', 'anything else to find her, and stay near her, so he flew out into the', 'world, to seek her.', 'He sought her in many lands, until one day, in a far eastern country, he', 'found her sitting in a tent, by the side of an old, white-haired hermit.', 'Cherry was wild with delight. He flew to her shoulder, caressed her hair', 'with his beak, and cooed in her ear.', '\"You dear, lovely little thing!\" said Zelia. \"Will you stay with me? If', 'you will, I will love you always.\"', '\"Ah, Zelia, see what you have done!\" laughed the hermit. At that', 'instant, the white dove vanished, and Prince Cherry stood there, as', 'handsome and charming as ever, and with a look of kindness and modesty', 'in his eyes which had never been there before. At the same time, the', 'hermit stood up, his flowing hair changed to shining gold, and his face', 'became a lovely woman\\'s face; it was the Fairy Candide. \"Zelia has', 'broken your spell,\" she said to the prince, \"as I meant she should, when', 'you were worthy of her love.\"', \"Zelia and Prince Cherry fell at the fairy's feet. But with a beautiful\", 'smile she bade them come to their kingdom. In a trice, they were', \"transported to the prince's palace, where King Suliman greeted them with\", 'tears of joy. He gave back the throne with all his heart, and King', 'Cherry ruled again, with Zelia for his queen.', 'He wore the little gold ring all the rest of his life, but never once', 'did it have to prick him hard enough to make his finger bleed.', 'THE GOLD IN THE ORCHARD', 'There was once a farmer who had a fine olive orchard. He was very', 'industrious, and the farm always prospered under his care. But he knew', 'that his three sons despised the farm work, and were eager to make', 'wealth fast, through adventure.', 'When the farmer was old, and felt that his time had come to die, he', 'called the three sons to him and said, \"My sons, there is a pot of gold', 'hidden in the olive orchard. Dig for it, if you wish it.\"', 'The sons tried to get him to tell them in what part of the orchard the', 'gold was hidden; but he would tell them nothing more.', 'After the farmer was dead, the sons went to work to find the pot of', 'gold; since they did not know where the hiding-place was, they agreed to', 'begin in a line, at one end of the orchard, and to dig until one of them', 'should find the money.', 'They dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard', 'to the other, round the tree-roots and between them. But no pot of gold', 'was to be found. It seemed as if some one must have stolen it, or as if', 'the farmer had been wandering in his wits. The three sons were bitterly', 'disappointed to have all their work for nothing.', 'The next olive season, the olive trees in the orchard bore more fruit', 'than they had ever given before; the fine cultivating they had had from', 'the digging brought so much fruit, and of so fine a quality, that when', 'it was sold it gave the sons a whole pot of gold!', 'And when they saw how much money had come from the orchard, they', 'suddenly understood what the wise father had meant when he said, \"There', 'is gold hidden in the orchard; dig for it.\"', 'MARGARET OF NEW ORLEANS', 'If you ever go to the beautiful city of New Orleans, somebody will be', 'sure to take you down into the old business part of the city, where', 'there are banks and shops and hotels, and show you a statue which stands', 'in a little square there. It is the statue of a woman, sitting in a low', 'chair, with her arms around a child, who leans against her. The woman is', 'not at all pretty: she wears thick, common shoes, a plain dress, with a', 'little shawl, and a sun-bonnet; she is stout and short, and her face is', 'a square-chinned Irish face; but her eyes look at you like your', \"mother's.\", 'Now there is something very surprising about this statue: it was the', 'first one that was ever made in America in honour of a woman. Even in', 'Europe there are not many monuments to women, and most of the few are to', 'great queens or princesses, very beautiful and very richly dressed. You', 'see, this statue in New Orleans is not quite like anything else.', 'It is the statue of a woman named Margaret. Her whole name was Margaret', 'Haughery, but no one in New Orleans remembers her by it, any more than', 'you think of your dearest sister by her full name; she is just Margaret.', 'This is her story, and it tells why people made a monument for her.', 'When Margaret was a tiny baby, her father and mother died, and she was', 'adopted by two young people as poor and as kind as her own parents. She', 'lived with them until she grew up. Then she married, and had a little', 'baby of her own. But very soon her husband died, and then the baby died,', 'too, and Margaret was all alone in the world. She was poor, but she was', 'strong, and knew how to work.', 'All day, from morning until evening, she ironed clothes in a laundry.', 'And every day, as she worked by the window, she saw the little', 'motherless children from the orphan asylum, near by, working and', 'playing about. After a while, there came a great sickness upon the city,', 'and so many mothers and fathers died that there were more orphans than', 'the asylum could possibly take care of. They needed a good friend, now.', 'You would hardly think, would you, that a poor woman who worked in a', 'laundry could be much of a friend to them? But Margaret was. She went', 'straight to the kind Sisters who had the asylum and told them she was', 'going to give them part of her wages and was going to work for them,', 'besides. Pretty soon she had worked so hard that she had some money', 'saved from her wages. With this, she bought two cows and a little', 'delivery cart. Then she carried her milk to her customers in the little', 'cart every morning; and as she went, she begged the pieces of food left', 'over from the hotels and rich houses, and brought it back in the cart to', 'the hungry children in the asylum. In the very hardest times that was', 'often all the food the poor children had.', 'A part of the money Margaret earned went every week to the asylum, and', 'after a few years that was made very much larger and better. Margaret', 'was so careful and so good at business that, in spite of her giving, she', 'bought more cows and earned more money. With this, she built a home for', 'orphan babies; she called it her baby house.', 'After a time, Margaret had a chance to get a bakery, and then she became', 'a bread-woman instead of a milk-woman. She carried the bread just as she', 'had carried the milk, in her cart. And still she kept giving money to', 'the asylum. Then the great war came, the Civil War. In all the trouble', 'and sickness and fear of that time, Margaret drove her cart of bread;', 'and somehow she had always enough to give the starving soldiers, and for', 'her babies, beside what she sold. And despite all this, she earned', 'enough so that when the war was over she built a big steam factory for', 'her bread. By this time everybody in the city knew her. The children all', 'over the city loved her; the business men were proud of her; the poor', 'people all came to her for advice. She used to sit at the open door of', 'her office, in a calico gown and a little shawl, and give a good word to', 'everybody, rich or poor.', 'Then, by and by, one day, Margaret died. And when it was time to read', 'her will, the people found that, with all her giving, she had still', 'saved a great deal of money, and that she had left every penny of it to', 'the different orphan asylums of the city,--each one of them was given', 'something. Whether they were for white children or black, for Jews,', 'Catholics, or Protestants, made no difference; for Margaret always said,', '\"They are all orphans alike.\" And just think, dears, that splendid,', 'wise will was signed with a cross instead of a name, for Margaret had', 'never learned to read or write!', 'When the people of New Orleans knew that Margaret was dead, they said,', '\"She was a mother to the motherless; she was a friend to those who had', 'no friends; she had wisdom greater than schools can teach; we will not', 'let her memory go from us.\" So they made a statue of her, just as she', 'used to look, sitting in her own office door, or driving in her own', 'little cart. And there it stands to-day, in memory of the great love and', 'the great power of plain Margaret Haughery, of New Orleans.', \"THE DAGDA'S HARP\", 'You know, dears, in the old countries there are many fine stories about', 'things which happened so very long ago that nobody knows exactly how', 'much of them is true. Ireland is like that. It is so old that even as', 'long ago as four thousand years it had people who dug in the mines, and', 'knew how to weave cloth and to make beautiful ornaments out of gold, and', 'who could fight and make laws; but we do not know just where they came', 'from, nor exactly how they lived. These people left us some splendid', 'stories about their kings, their fights, and their beautiful women; but', 'it all happened such a long time ago that the stories are mixtures of', 'things that really happened and what people said about them, and we', \"don't know just which is which. The stories are called _legends_. One of\", 'the prettiest legends is the story I am going to tell you about the', \"Dagda's harp.\", 'It is said that there were two quite different kinds of people in', 'Ireland: one set of people with long dark hair and dark eyes, called', 'Fomorians--they carried long slender spears made of golden bronze when', 'they fought--and another race of people who were golden-haired and', 'blue-eyed, and who carried short, blunt, heavy spears of dull metal.', 'The golden-haired people had a great chieftain who was also a kind of', 'high priest, who was called the Dagda. And this Dagda had a wonderful', 'magic harp. The harp was beautiful to look upon, mighty in size, made of', 'rare wood, and ornamented with gold and jewels; and it had wonderful', 'music in its strings, which only the Dagda could call out. When the men', 'were going out to battle, the Dagda would set up his magic harp and', 'sweep his hand across the strings, and a war song would ring out which', 'would make every warrior buckle on his armour, brace his knees, and', 'shout, \"Forth to the fight!\" Then, when the men came back from the', 'battle, weary and wounded, the Dagda would take his harp and strike a', 'few chords, and as the magic music stole out upon the air, every man', 'forgot his weariness and the smart of his wounds, and thought of the', 'honour he had won, and of the comrade who had died beside him, and of', 'the safety of his wife and children. Then the song would swell out', 'louder, and every warrior would remember only the glory he had helped', 'win for the king; and each man would rise at the great table, his cup in', 'his hand, and shout \"Long live the King!\"', 'There came a time when the Fomorians and the golden-haired men were at', \"war; and in the midst of a great battle, while the Dagda's hall was not\", 'so well guarded as usual, some of the chieftains of the Fomorians stole', 'the great harp from the wall, where it hung, and fled away with it.', 'Their wives and children and some few of their soldiers went with them,', 'and they fled fast and far through the night, until they were a long way', 'from the battlefield. Then they thought they were safe, and they turned', 'aside into a vacant castle, by the road, and sat down to a banquet,', 'hanging the stolen harp on the wall.', 'The Dagda, with two or three of his warriors, had followed hard on their', 'track. And while they were in the midst of their banqueting, the door', 'was suddenly burst open, and the Dagda stood there, with his men. Some', 'of the Fomorians sprang to their feet, but before any of them could', 'grasp a weapon, the Dagda called out to his harp on the wall, \"Come to', 'me, O my harp!\"', \"The great harp recognised its master's voice, and leaped from the wall.\", 'Whirling through the hall, sweeping aside and killing the men who got in', \"its way, it sprang to its master's hand. And the Dagda took his harp and\", 'swept his hand across the strings in three great, solemn chords. The', 'harp answered with the magic Music of Tears. As the wailing harmony', 'smote upon the air, the women of the Fomorians bowed their heads and', 'wept bitterly, the strong men turned their faces aside, and the little', 'children sobbed.', 'Again the Dagda touched the strings, and this time the magic Music of', 'Mirth leaped from the harp. And when they heard that Music of Mirth, the', 'young warriors of the Fomorians began to laugh; they laughed till the', 'cups fell from their grasp, and the spears dropped from their hands,', 'while the wine flowed from the broken bowls; they laughed until their', 'limbs were helpless with excess of glee.', 'Once more the Dagda touched his harp, but very, very softly. And now a', 'music stole forth as soft as dreams, and as sweet as joy: it was the', 'magic Music of Sleep. When they heard that, gently, gently, the Fomorian', 'women bowed their heads in slumber; the little children crept to their', \"mothers' laps; the old men nodded; and the young warriors drooped in\", 'their seats and closed their eyes: one after another all the Fomorians', 'sank into sleep.', 'When they were all deep in slumber, the Dagda took his magic harp, and', 'he and his golden-haired warriors stole softly away, and came in safety', 'to their own homes again.', 'THE TAILOR AND THE THREE BEASTS', 'There was once a tailor in Galway, and he started out on a journey to go', \"to the king's court at Dublin.\", 'He had not gone far when he met a white horse, and he saluted him.', '\"God save you,\" said the tailor.', '\"God save you,\" said the horse. \"Where are you going?\"', '\"I am going to Dublin,\" said the tailor, \"to build a court for the king', 'and to get a lady for a wife, if I am able to do it.\" For, it seems the', 'king had promised his daughter and a great lot of money to anyone who', 'should be able to build up his court. The trouble was, that three giants', 'lived in the wood near the court, and every night they came out of the', 'wood and threw down all that was built by day. So nobody could get the', 'court built.', '\"Would you make me a hole,\" said the old white garraun, \"where I could', 'go in to hide whenever the people come to fetch me to the mill or the', \"kiln, so that they won't see me; for they tire me out doing work for\", 'them?\"', '\"I\\'ll do that, indeed,\" said the tailor, \"and welcome.\"', 'He brought his spade and shovel, and he made a hole, and he asked the', 'old white horse to go down into it so that he could see if it would fit', 'him.

In those days men were apt to invent stories to', 'account for things about them which seemed peculiar, and loving the sea', 'as they did, it is not strange that they had remarked the peculiarity of', 'the ocean water and had found a reason why it is so different from the', 'water in the rivers and steams.', 'This is not the only story that has come down to tell us how people of', 'old accounted for the sea being salt. There are many such stories, each', 'different from the other, all showing that the same childlike spirit of', 'inquiry was at work in different places, striving to find an answer to', 'this riddle of nature.', '       *       *       *       *       *', 'There sprang from the sons of Odin a race of men who became mighty kings', 'of the earth, and one of these, named Frode, ruled over the lands that', 'are called Denmark.', 'Now about this time were found in Denmark two great millstones, so large', 'that no one had the strength to turn them. So Frode sent for all the', 'wise men of the land and bade them examine the stones and tell him of', 'what use they were, since no one could grind with them.', 'And after the wise men had looked closely at them and read the magic', 'letters which were cut upon their edge, they said that the millstones', 'were precious indeed, since they would grind out of nothing anything', 'that the miller might wish.', 'So King Frode sent messengers over the world to find for him two', 'servants who would be strong enough to grind with the millstones, and', 'after a long, long time his messengers found him two maid-servants, who', 'were bigger and stronger than anyone in Denmark had ever seen. But no', 'one guessed that these were really Giant-Maidens who bore a grudge', 'against all of the race of Odin.', 'Directly the Giant-Maidens were brought before Frode, and before they', 'had rested after their long journey, or satisfied their hunger, he bade', 'them go to the mill, and grind for him gold and peace and happiness.', '     \"They sang and swung', '      The swift mill stone,', '      And with loud voice', '      They made their moan.', \"      'We grind for Frode\", '      Wealth and gold', '      Abundant riches', '      He shall behold.\\'\"', 'Presently Frode came into the mill to see that the new servants were', 'performing their task diligently. And as he watched them from the shadow', 'by the door, the maidens stayed their grinding for a while to rest.', \"The greedy man could not bear to see even an instant's pause, and he\", 'came out of the shadow, and bade them, with harsh words, go on grinding,', 'and cease not except for so long as the cuckoo was silent, or while he', 'himself sang a song. Now it was early summer-time, and the cuckoo was', 'calling all the day and most of the night.', 'So the Giant-Maidens waxed very wroth with King Frode, and as they', 'resumed their labours they sang a song of the hardness of their lot in', 'the household of this pitiless King.', 'They had been grinding out wealth and happiness and peace, but now they', 'bade the magic stones to grind something very different.', 'Presently, as the great stones moved round and round, Frode, who still', 'stood by, heard one chant in a low, sing-song voice,--', '\"I see a fire east of the town--the curlews awake and sound a note of', 'warning. A host approaches in haste, to burn the dwelling of the king.\"', 'And the next took up her song,--', '\"No longer will Frode sit on his throne, and rule over rings of red gold', 'and mighty millstones. Now must we grind with all our might--and,', 'behold! red warriors come forth--and revenge, and bloodshed, and ruin.\"', 'Then Frode shook from head to foot in his terror, for he heard the tramp', 'of a mighty host of warriors advancing from the sea. And as he looked', 'for a way of escape, the braces of the millstones broke with the strong', 'grinding, and fell in two. And the whole world shook and trembled with', 'the mighty shock of that breaking.', 'But through the crash and din came the voices of the Giant-Maidens,', 'loudly chanting,--', '     \"We have turned the stone round;', '      Though weary the maidens,', '      See what they have ground!\"', 'And that same night a mighty sea-king came up and slew Frode and', 'plundered his city.', 'When he had sacked the city, the sea-king took on board his ship the two', 'Giant-Maidens, and with them the broken millstones. And he bade them', 'begin at once to grind salt, for of this he had very scanty store.', 'So they ground and ground; and in the middle of the night, being weary,', 'they asked the sea-king if he had not got salt enough.', 'But the sea-king was hard of heart, like Frode, and he roughly bade them', 'go on grinding. And the maidens did so, and worked to such effect that', 'within a short time the millstones had ground out so much salt that the', 'weight of it began to sink the ship. Down, down it sank, ship and giants', 'and millstones, and in that spot, in the very middle of the ocean, arose', 'a whirlpool, from whence the salt is carried north and south, east and', 'west, throughout the waters of the earth.', 'And that is how the sea became salt.', 'THE CASTLE OF FORTUNE', 'One lovely summer morning, just as the sun rose, two travellers started', 'on a journey. They were both strong young men, but one was a lazy fellow', 'and the other was a worker.', 'As the first sunbeams came over the hills, they shone on a great castle', 'standing on the heights, as far away as the eye could see. It was a', 'wonderful and beautiful castle, all glistening towers that gleamed like', 'marble, and glancing windows that shone like crystal. The two young men', 'looked at it eagerly, and longed to go nearer.', 'Suddenly, out of the distance, something like a great butterfly, of', 'white and gold, swept toward them. And when it came nearer, they saw', 'that it was a most beautiful lady, robed in floating garments as fine as', 'cobwebs and wearing on her head a crown so bright that no one could tell', 'whether it was of diamonds or of dew. She stood, light as air, on a', 'great, shining, golden ball, which rolled along with her, swifter than', 'the wind. As she passed the travellers, she turned her face to them and', 'smiled.', '\"Follow me!\" she said.', 'The lazy man sat down in the grass with a discontented sigh. \"She has', 'an easy time of it!\" he said.', 'But the industrious man ran after the lovely lady and caught the hem of', 'her floating robe in his grasp. \"Who are you, and whither are you', 'going?\" he asked.', '\"I am the Fairy of Fortune,\" the beautiful lady said, \"and that is my', 'castle. You may reach it to-day, if you will; there is time, if you', 'waste none. If you reach it before the last stroke of midnight, I will', 'receive you there, and will be your friend. But if you come one second', 'after midnight, it will be too late.\"', \"When she had said this, her robe slipped from the traveller's hand and\", 'she was gone.', 'The industrious man hurried back to his friend, and told him what the', 'fairy had said.', '\"The idea!\" said the lazy, man, and he laughed; \"of course, if we had a', 'horse there would be some chance, but _walk_ all that way? No, thank', 'you!\"', '\"Then good-bye,\" said his friend, \"I am off.\" And he set out, down the', 'road toward the shining castle, with a good steady stride, his eyes', 'straight ahead.', 'The lazy man lay down in the soft grass, and looked rather wistfully at', 'the far-away towers. \"If only I had a good horse!\" he sighed.', 'Just at that moment he felt something warm nosing about at his shoulder,', 'and heard a little whinny. He turned round, and there stood a little', 'horse! It was a dainty creature, gentle-looking, and finely built, and', 'it was saddled and bridled.', '\"Hello!\" said the lazy man. \"Luck often comes when one isn\\'t looking for', 'it!\" And in an instant he had leaped on the horse, and headed him for', 'the castle of fortune. The little horse started at a fine pace, and in a', 'very few minutes they overtook the other traveller, plodding along on', 'foot.', '\"How do you like shank\\'s pony?\" laughed the lazy man, as he passed his', 'friend.', 'The industrious man only nodded, and kept on with his steady stride,', 'eyes straight ahead.', 'The horse kept his good pace, and by noon the towers of the castle stood', 'out against the sky, much nearer and more beautiful. Exactly at noon,', 'the horse turned aside from the road, into a shady grove on a hill, and', 'stopped.', '\"Wise beast,\" said his rider: \"\\'haste makes waste,\\' and all things are', 'better in moderation. I\\'ll follow your example, and eat and rest a bit.\"', 'He dismounted and sat down in the cool moss, with his back against a', \"tree. He had a lunch in his traveller's pouch, and he ate it\", 'comfortably. Then he felt drowsy from the heat and the early ride, so he', 'pulled his hat over his eyes, and settled himself for a nap. \"It will go', 'all the better for a little rest,\" he said.', 'That _was_ a sleep! He slept like the seven sleepers, and he dreamed the', 'most beautiful things you could imagine. At last, he dreamed that he had', 'entered the castle of fortune and was being received with great', 'festivities. Everything he wanted was brought to him, and music played', 'while fireworks were set off in his honour. The music was so loud that', 'he awoke. He sat up, rubbing his eyes, and behold, the fireworks were', 'the very last rays of the setting sun, and the music was the voice of', 'the other traveller, passing the grove on foot!', '\"Time to be off,\" said the lazy man, and looked about him for the pretty', 'horse. No horse was to be found. The only living thing near was an old,', 'bony, grey donkey. The man called, and whistled, and looked, but no', 'little horse appeared. After a long while he gave it up, and, since', 'there was nothing better to do, he mounted the old grey donkey and set', 'out again.', 'The donkey was slow, and he was hard to ride, but he was better than', 'nothing; and gradually the lazy man saw the towers of the castle draw', 'nearer.', 'Now it began to grow dark; in the castle windows the lights began to', 'show. Then came trouble! Slower, and slower, went the grey donkey;', 'slower, and slower, till, in the very middle of a pitch-black wood, he', 'stopped and stood still. Not a step would he budge for all the coaxing', 'and scolding and beating his rider could give. At last the rider kicked', 'him, as well as beat him, and at that the donkey felt that he had had', 'enough. Up went his hind heels, and down went his head, and over it went', 'the lazy man on to the stony ground.', 'There he lay groaning for many minutes, for it was not a soft place, I', 'can assure you. How he wished he were in a soft, warm bed, with his', 'aching bones comfortable in blankets! The very thought of it made him', 'remember the Castle of Fortune, for he knew there must be fine beds', 'there. To get to those beds he was even willing to bestir his poor', 'limbs, so he sat up and felt about him for the donkey.', 'No donkey was to be found.', 'The lazy man crept round and round the spot where he had fallen,', 'scratched his hands on the stumps, tore his face in the briers, and', 'bumped his knees on the stones. But no donkey was there. He would have', 'laid down to sleep again, but he could hear now the howls of hungry', 'wolves in the woods; that it did not sound pleasant. Finally, his hand', 'struck against something that felt like a saddle. He grasped it,', 'thankfully, and started to mount his donkey.', 'The beast he took hold of seemed very small, and, as he mounted, he felt', 'that its sides were moist and slimy. It gave him a shudder, and he', 'hesitated; but at that moment he heard a distant clock strike. It was', 'striking eleven! There was still time to reach the castle of fortune,', 'but no more than enough; so he mounted his new steed and rode on once', 'more. The animal was easier to sit on than the donkey, and the saddle', 'seemed remarkably high behind; it was good to lean against. But even the', 'donkey was not so slow as this; the new steed was slower than he. After', 'a while, however, he pushed his way out of the woods into the open, and', 'there stood the castle, only a little way ahead! All its windows were', \"ablaze with lights. A ray from them fell on the lazy man's beast, and he\", 'saw what he was riding: it was a gigantic snail! a snail as large as a', 'calf!', \"A cold shudder ran over the lazy man's body, and he would have got off\", 'his horrid animal then and there, but just then the clock struck once', 'more. It was the first of the long, slow strokes that mark midnight! The', \"man grew frantic when he heard it. He drove his heels into the snail's\", 'sides, to make him hurry. Instantly, the snail drew in his head, curled', 'up in his shell, and left the lazy man sitting in a heap on the ground!', 'The clock struck twice. If the man had run for it, he could still have', 'reached the castle, but, instead, he sat still and shouted for a horse.', '\"A beast, a beast!\" he wailed, \"any kind of a beast that will take me to', 'the castle!\"', 'The clock struck three times. And as it struck the third note, something', 'came rustling and rattling out of the darkness, something that sounded', 'like a horse with harness. The lazy man jumped on its back, a very', 'queer, low back. As he mounted, he saw the doors of the castle open, and', 'saw his friend standing on the threshold, waving his cap and beckoning', 'to him.', 'The clock struck four times, and the new steed began to stir; as it', 'struck five, he moved a pace forward; as it struck six, he stopped; as', 'it struck seven, he turned himself about; as it struck eight, he began', 'to move backward, away from the castle!', 'The lazy man shouted, and beat him, but the beast went slowly backward.', 'And the clock struck nine. The man tried to slide off, then, but from', 'all sides of his strange animal great arms came reaching up and held him', 'fast. And in the next ray of moonlight that broke the dark clouds, he', 'saw that he was mounted on a monster crab!', 'One by one, the lights went out, in the castle windows. The clock struck', 'ten. Backward went the crab. Eleven! Still the crab went backward. The', 'clock struck twelve! Then the great doors shut with a clang, and the', 'castle of fortune was closed for ever to the lazy man.', 'What became of him and his crab no one knows to this day, and no one', 'cares. But the industrious man was received by the Fairy of Fortune, and', 'made happy in the castle as long as he wanted to stay. And ever', 'afterward she was his friend, helping him not only to happiness for', 'himself, but also showing him how to help others, wherever he went.', 'DAVID AND GOLIATH', 'A long time ago, there was a boy named David, who lived in a country in', 'the Far East. He was good to look upon, for he had fair hair and a ruddy', 'skin; and he was very strong and brave and modest. He was shepherd-boy', 'for his father, and all day--often all night--he was out in the fields,', 'far from home, watching over the sheep. He had to guard them from wild', 'animals, and lead them to the right pastures, and care for them.', \"By and by, war broke out between the people of David's country and a\", 'people that lived near at hand; these men were called Philistines, and', \"the people of David's country were named Israelites. All the strong men\", \"of Israel went up to the battle, to fight for their king. David's three\", 'older brothers went, but he was only a boy, so he was left behind to', 'care for the sheep.', \"After the brothers had been gone some time, David's father longed very\", 'much to hear from them, and to know if they were safe; so he sent for', 'David, from the fields, and said to him, \"Take now for thy brothers an', 'ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp,', 'where thy brothers are; and carry these ten cheeses to the captain of', 'their thousand, and see how thy brothers fare, and bring me word again.\"', '(An ephah is about three pecks.)', 'David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and', 'took the corn and the loaves and the cheeses, as his father had', 'commanded him, and went to the camp of the Israelites.', 'The camp stood on a mountain on the one side, and the Philistines stood', 'on a mountain on the other side; and there was a valley between. David', 'came to the place where the Israelites were, just as the host was going', 'forth to the fight, shouting for the battle. So he left his gifts in the', 'hands of the keeper of the baggage, and ran into the army, amongst the', 'soldiers, to find his brothers. When he found them, he saluted them and', 'began to talk with them.', 'But while he was asking them the questions his father had commanded,', 'there arose a great shouting and tumult among the Israelites, and men', 'came running back from the front line of battle; everything became', 'confusion. David looked to see what the trouble was, and he saw a', 'strange sight: down the slope of the opposite mountain came striding a', 'Philistine warrior, calling out something in a taunting voice; he was a', 'gigantic man, the largest David had ever seen, and he was covered with', 'armour, that shone in the sun: he had a helmet of brass upon his head,', 'and he was armed with a coat of mail, and he had greaves of brass upon', 'his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders; his spear was so', \"tremendous that the staff of it was like a weaver's beam, and his shield\", 'so great that a man went before him, to carry it.', '\"Who is that?\" asked David.', '\"It is Goliath, of Gath, champion of the Philistines,\" said the soldiers', 'about. \"Every day, for forty days, he has come forth, so, and challenged', 'us to send a man against him, in single combat; and since no one dares', 'to go out against him alone, the armies cannot fight.\" (That was one of', 'the laws of warfare in those times.)', '\"What!\" said David, \"does none dare go out against him?\"', 'As he spoke, the giant stood still, on the hillside opposite the host', 'of Israel, and shouted his challenge, scornfully. He said, \"Why are ye', 'come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and ye', 'servants of Saul? Choose you a man, and let him come down to me. If he', 'be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants;', 'but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our', 'servants, and serve us. I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a', 'man, that we may fight together!\"', 'When King Saul heard these words, he was dismayed, and all the men of', 'Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were sore afraid. David', 'heard them talking among themselves, whispering and murmuring. They were', 'saying, \"Have ye seen this man that is come up? Surely if anyone killeth', 'him that man will the king make rich; perhaps he will give him his', 'daughter in marriage, and make his family free in Israel!\"', 'David heard this, and he asked the men if it were so. It was surely so,', 'they said.', '\"But,\" said David, \"who is this Philistine, that he should defy the', 'armies of the living God?\" And he was stirred with anger.', 'Very soon, some of the officers told the king about the youth who was', 'asking so many questions, and who said that it was shame upon Israel', 'that a mere Philistine should defy the armies of the living God.', 'Immediately Saul sent for him. When David came before Saul, he said to', 'the king, \"Let no man\\'s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go', 'and fight with this Philistine.\"', 'But Saul looked at David, and said, \"Thou art not able to go against', 'this Philistine, to fight with him, for thou art but a youth, and he has', 'been a man of war from his youth.\"', 'Then David said to Saul, \"Once I was keeping my father\\'s sheep, and', 'there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock; and I', 'went out after the lion, and struck him; and delivered the lamb out of', 'his mouth, and when he arose against me, I caught him by the beard, and', 'struck him, and slew him! Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear;', 'and this Philistine shall be as one of them, for he hath defied the', 'armies of the living God. The Lord, who delivered me out of the paw of', 'the lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the', 'hand of this Philistine.\"', '\"Go,\" said Saul, \"and the Lord be with thee!\"', 'And he armed David with his own armour,--he put a helmet of brass upon', 'his head, and armed him with a coat of mail. But when David girded his', 'sword upon his armour, and tried to walk, he said to Saul, \"I cannot go', 'with these, for I am not used to them.\" And he put them off.', 'Then he took his staff in his hand and went and chose five smooth stones', \"out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had; and his\", 'sling was in his hand; and he went out and drew near to the Philistine.', 'And the Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man that bore', 'his shield went before him. And when the Philistine looked about and saw', 'David, he disdained him, for David was but a boy, and ruddy, and of a', 'fair countenance. And he said to David, \"Am I a dog, that thou comest to', 'me with a cudgel?\" And with curses he cried out again, \"Come to me, and', 'I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of', 'the field.\"', 'But David looked at him, and answered, \"Thou comest to me with a sword,', 'and with a spear, and with a shield; but I come to thee in the name of', 'the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast', 'defied. This day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand, and I will', 'smite thee, and take thy head from thee, and I will give the carcasses', 'of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and', 'to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there', 'is a God in Israel!

Twice, when\", 'David had a chance to kill the king, he forbore to harm him; but even', 'then, Saul continued trying to take his life, and David was kept away', 'from his home as if he were an enemy.', 'But when King Saul died, the people chose David for their king, because', 'there was no one so brave, so wise, or so faithful to God. King David', 'lived a long time, and made his people famous for victory and happiness;', 'he had many troubles and many wars, but he always trusted that God would', 'help him, and he never deserted his own people in any hard place.', 'After a battle, or when it was a holiday, or when he was very thankful', 'for something, King David used to make songs, and sing them before the', 'people. Some of these songs were so beautiful that they have never been', 'forgotten. After all these hundreds and hundred of years, we sing them', 'still; we call them Psalms.', 'Often, after David had made a song, his chief musician would sing with', 'him, as the people gathered to worship God. Sometimes the singers were', 'divided into two great choruses, and went to the service in two', \"processions; then one chorus would sing a verse of David's song, and the\", 'other procession would answer with the next, and then both would sing', 'together; it was very beautiful to hear. Even now, we sometimes do that', 'with the songs of David in our churches.', 'One of his Psalms that everybody loves is a song that David made when he', \"remembered the days before he came to Saul's camp. He remembered the\", 'days and nights he used to spend in the fields with the sheep, when he', 'was just a shepherd-boy; and he thought to himself that God had taken', 'care of him just as carefully as he himself used to care for the little', 'lambs. It is a beautiful song; I wish we knew the music that David made', 'for it, but we only know his words. I will tell it to you now, and then', 'you may learn it, to say for yourselves.', '     The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.', '     He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me', '     beside the still waters.', '     He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of', \"     righteousness for his name's sake.\", '     Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of', '     death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod', '     and thy staff they comfort me.', '     Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine', '     enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth', '     over.', '     Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my', '     life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.=', 'THE HIDDEN SERVANTS', 'This is a legend about a hermit who lived long ago. He lived high up on', 'the mountainside in a tiny cave; his food was roots and acorns, a bit of', 'bread given by a peasant, or a cheese brought by a woman who wanted his', 'prayers; his work was praying, and thinking about God. For forty years', 'he lived so, preaching to the people, praying for them, comforting them', 'in trouble, and, most of all, worshipping in his heart. There was just', 'one thing he cared about: it was to make his soul so pure and perfect', \"that it could be one of the stones in God's great Temple of Heaven.\", 'One day, after the forty years, he had a great longing to know how far', 'along he had got with his work,--how it looked to the Heavenly Father.', 'And he prayed that he might be shown a man--', '     \"Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown', '      To the selfsame measure as his own;', '      Whose treasure on the celestial shore', '      Could neither be less than his nor more.\"', 'As he looked up from his prayer, a white-robed angel stood in the path', 'before him. The hermit bowed before the messenger with great gladness,', 'for he knew that his wish was answered. \"Go to the nearest town,\" the', 'angel said, \"and there, in the public square, you will find a mountebank', '(a clown) making the people laugh for money. He is the man you seek; his', 'soul has grown to the selfsame stature as your own; his treasure on the', 'celestial shore is neither less than yours nor more.\"', 'When the angel had faded from sight, the hermit bowed his head again,', 'but this time with great sorrow and fear. Had his forty years of prayer', 'been a terrible mistake, and was his soul indeed like a clown, fooling', 'in the market-place? He knew not what to think. Almost he hoped he', 'should not find the man, and could believe that he had dreamed the angel', 'vision. But when he came, after a long, tiring walk to the village, and', 'the square, alas! there was the clown, doing his silly tricks for the', 'crowd.', 'The hermit stood and looked at him with terror and sadness, for he felt', 'that he was looking at his own soul. The face he saw was thin and tired,', 'and though it kept a smile or a grin for the people, it seemed very sad', \"to the hermit. Soon the man felt the hermit's eyes; he could not go on\", 'with his tricks. And when he had stopped and the crowd had left, the', 'hermit went and drew the man aside to a place where they could rest; for', \"he wanted more than anything else on earth to know what the man's soul\", 'was like, because what it was, his was.', 'So, after a little, he asked the clown, very gently, what his life was,', 'what it had been. And the clown answered, very sadly, that it was just', 'as it looked,--a life of foolish tricks, for that was the only way of', 'earning his bread that he knew.', '\"But have you never been anything different?\" asked the hermit,', 'painfully.', 'The clown\\'s head sank in his hands. \"Yes, holy father,\" he said, \"I have', 'been something else. I was a thief! I once belonged to the most wicked', 'band of mountain robbers that ever tormented the land, and I was as', 'wicked as the worst.\"', 'Alas! The hermit felt that his heart was breaking. Was this how he', 'looked to the Heavenly Father--like a thief, a cruel mountain robber? He', 'could hardly speak, and the tears streamed from his old eyes, but he', 'gathered strength to ask one more question. \"I beg you,\" he said, \"if', 'you have ever done a single good deed in your life, remember it now, and', 'tell it to me\"; for he thought that even one good deed would save him', 'from utter despair.', '\"Yes, one,\" the clown said, \"but it was so small, it is not worth', 'telling; my life has been worthless.\"', '\"Tell me that one!\" pleaded the hermit.', '\"Once,\" said the man, \"our band broke into a convent garden and stole', 'away one of the nuns, to sell as a slave or to keep for a ransom. We', 'dragged her with us over the rough, long way to our mountain camp, and', 'set a guard over her for the night. The poor thing prayed to us so', 'piteously to let her go! And as she begged, she looked from one hard', 'face to another, with trusting, imploring eyes, as if she could not', 'believe men could be really bad. Father, when her eyes met mine', 'something pierced my heart! Pity and shame leaped up, for the first', 'time, within me. But I made my face as hard and cruel as the rest, and', 'she turned away, hopeless.', '\"When all was dark and still, I stole like a cat to where she lay bound.', \"I put my hand on her wrist and whispered, 'Trust me, and I will take you\", \"safely home.' I cut her bonds with my knife, and she looked at me to\", 'show that she trusted. Father, by terrible ways that I knew, hidden from', 'the others, I took her safe to the convent gate. She knocked; they', 'opened; and she slipped inside. And, as she left me, she turned and', \"said, 'God will remember.'\", '\"That was all. I could not go back to the old bad life, and I had never', 'learned an honest way to earn my bread. So I became a clown, and must be', 'a clown until I die.\"', '\"No! no! my son,\" cried the hermit, and now his tears were tears of joy.', '\"God has remembered; your soul is in his sight even as mine, who have', 'prayed and preached for forty years. Your treasure waits for you on the', 'heavenly shore just as mine does.\"', '\"As _yours_? Father, you mock me!\" said the clown.', \"But when the hermit told him the story of his prayer and the angel's\", 'answer, the poor clown was transfigured with joy, for he knew that his', 'sins were forgiven. And when the hermit went home to his mountain, the', 'clown went with him. He, too, became a hermit, and spent his time in', 'praise and prayer.', 'Together they lived, and worked, and helped the poor. And when, after', 'two years, the man who had been a clown died, the hermit felt that he', 'had lost a brother more holy than himself.', 'For ten years more the hermit lived in his mountain hut, thinking always', 'of God, fasting and praying, and doing no least thing that was wrong.', 'Then, one day, the wish once more came, to know how his work was', 'growing, and once more he prayed that he might see a being--', '     \"Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown', '      To the selfsame measure as his own;', '      Whose treasure on the celestial shore', '      Could neither be less than his nor more.\"', 'Once more his prayer was answered. The angel came to him, and told him', 'to go to a certain village on the other side of the mountain, and to a', 'small farm in it, where two women lived. In them he should find two', \"souls like his own, in God's sight.\", 'When the hermit came to the door of the little farm, the two women who', 'lived there were overjoyed to see him, for everyone loved and honoured', 'his name. They put a chair for him on the cool porch, and brought food', 'and drink. But the hermit was too eager to wait. He longed greatly to', 'know what the souls of the two women were like, and from their looks he', 'could see only that they were gentle and honest. One was old, and the', 'other of middle age.', 'Presently he asked them about their lives. They told him the little', 'there was to tell: they had worked hard always, in the fields with their', 'husbands, or in the house; they had many children; they had seen hard', 'times,--sickness, sorrow; but they had never despaired.', '\"But what of your good deeds,\" the hermit asked,--\"what have you done', 'for God?\"', '\"Very little,\" they said, sadly, for they were too poor to give much. To', 'be sure, twice every year, when they killed a sheep for food, they gave', 'half to their poorer neighbours.', '\"That is very good, very faithful,\" the hermit said. \"And is there any', 'other good deed you have done?\"', '\"Nothing,\" said the older woman, \"unless, unless--it might be called a', 'good deed----\" She looked at the younger woman, who smiled back at her.', '\"What?\" said the hermit.', 'Still the woman hesitated; but at last she said, timidly, \"It is not', 'much to tell, father, only this, that it is twenty years since my', 'sister-in-law and I came to live together in the house; we have brought', 'up our families here; and in all the twenty years there has never been a', 'cross word between us, or a look that was less than kind.\"', 'The hermit bent his head before the two women, and gave thanks in his', 'heart. \"If my soul is as these,\" he said, \"I am blessed indeed.\"', \"And suddenly a great light came into the hermit's mind, and he saw how\", 'many ways there are of serving God. Some serve him in churches and in', \"hermits' cells, by praise and prayer; some poor souls who have been very\", 'wicked turn from their wickedness with sorrow, and serve him with', 'repentance; some live faithfully and gently in humble homes, working,', 'bringing up children, keeping kind and cheerful; some bear pain', 'patiently, for His sake. Endless, endless ways there are, that only the', 'Heavenly Father sees.', 'And so, as the hermit climbed the mountain again, he thought,--', '     \"As he saw the star-like glow', '      Of light, in the cottage windows far,', '      How many God\\'s hidden servants are!\"', 'LITTLE GOTTLIEB', 'Across the North Sea, in a country called Germany, lived a little boy', 'named Gottlieb. His father had died when he was but a baby, and although', 'from early morning till late at night his mother sat plying her needle,', 'she found it difficult indeed to provide food and clothing and shelter', 'for her little boy and herself.', 'Gottlieb was not old enough to work, but he would often sit on a small', \"stool at his mother's feet and dream about the wonderful things he would\", 'do for his dear mother when he grew to be a man, and she was comforted', 'as she looked upon her boy, and the thought that she was working for him', 'often gave strength to her tired fingers.', 'But one night Gottlieb saw that his mother was more than usually', 'troubled. Every now and then she would sigh, and a tear would trickle', 'down her cheek. The little boy had grown quick to read these signs of', 'distress, and he thought, \"Christmas will be here soon, and dear mother', 'is thinking of what a sad time it will be.\"', 'What would Gottlieb have given to be able to comfort his mother! He', 'could only sit and brood, while his young heart swelled and a lump rose', 'in his throat at the thought that he could do nothing.', 'Presently, however, a happy fancy came to him. Was not the Christ Child', 'born on Christmas Day, and did not He send good gifts to men on His', 'birthday? But then came the thought, \"He will never find us. Our home is', 'so mean and small.\" It seemed foolish to hope, but a boy is not long', 'cast down, and as Gottlieb sat dreaming, a happy inspiration came to', 'him. Stealing softly from the room he took paper and pen, for he had', 'learnt to write, and spelt out, word after word, a letter which he', 'addressed to the Christ Child.', 'You may be sure that the postman was puzzled what to do with this letter', 'when he sorted it out of the heap in the letter-box. Perhaps the', 'Burgomaster would know the right thing to do? So the postman took the', 'letter to the great burly man who lived in the big house and wore a gold', 'chain round his neck. The Burgomaster opened the envelope, and as he', 'read the letter written in the trembling hand of a child, tears came', 'into his eyes. But he spoke gruffly enough to the postman, \"This must', 'be a foolish boy; a small one, I have no doubt.\"', 'Soon Christmas morning dawned, and Gottlieb woke very early. But others', 'were up before him, for, to his surprise, he saw a strange gentleman', 'with his mother. His wondering eyes soon perceived other unusual', 'objects, for the hearth was piled with wood, and the table was loaded', 'with food and dainties such as he had never even imagined.', 'Gottlieb entered the room just as his mother threw herself at the', \"stranger's feet to bless him for his generous goodness to the widow and\", 'orphan. \"Nay, give me no thanks, worthy dame,\" said the visitor. \"Rather', 'be grateful to your little son, and to the good Lord to whom he wrote', 'for aid.\"', 'Then he turned to Gottlieb with a smile, \"You see that although you', 'wrote to the Christ Child, your prayer for aid came only to the', 'Burgomaster.

The', 'dark green Fir looks so majestic when laden with bright toys and lit up', 'by Christmas candles, that perhaps it is not easy to believe that it is', 'the most modest of trees. But so it is, and because of its humility it', 'was chosen to bear Christmas gifts to the children. This is the story:', 'When the Christ Child was born, all people, animals, trees, and other', 'plants felt that a great happiness had come into the world. And truly,', 'the Heavenly Father had sent with the Holy Babe His blessings of Peace', 'and Goodwill to all. Every day people came to see the sweet Babe,', 'bringing presents in their hands. By the stable wherein lay the Christ', 'Child stood three trees, and as the people came and went under their', 'spreading branches, they thought that they, too, would like to give', 'presents to the Child.', 'Said the Palm, \"I will choose my biggest leaf and place it as a fan', 'beside the manger to waft soft air to the Child.\"', '\"And I,\" said the Olive, \"I will sprinkle sweet-smelling oil over Him.\"', '\"What can I give to the Child?\" asked the Fir.', '\"You?\" said the others. \"You have nothing to offer. Your needles would', 'prick the wee Babe, and your tears are sticky.\"', 'This made the poor Fir very unhappy indeed, and it said, sadly, \"Yes,', 'you are right. I have nothing that would be good enough to offer to the', 'Christ Child.\"', 'Now, quite near to the trees had stood an Angel, who had heard all that', 'had passed. He was moved to pity the Fir, who was so lowly and without', 'envy of the other trees, and he resolved to help it.', 'High in the dark of the heavens the stars were beginning to twinkle, and', 'the Angel begged some of the little ones to come down and rest upon the', 'branches of the Fir.

Three thousand pounds! he could', 'spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\"--', 'He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively,', 'and he did not repent.', \"No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John\", 'Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her', 'mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants.', 'No one could dispute her right to come; the house was', \"her husband's from the moment of his father's decease;\", 'but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater,', \"and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only\", 'common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--', 'but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen,', 'a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind,', 'by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source', 'of immoveable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never', \"been a favourite with any of her husband's family;\", 'but she had had no opportunity, till the present,', 'of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort', 'of other people she could act when occasion required it.', 'So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious', 'behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her', 'daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter,', 'she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the', 'entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect', 'on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all', 'her three children determined her afterwards to stay,', 'and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.', 'Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was', 'so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,', 'and coolness of judgment, which qualified her,', 'though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother,', 'and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage', 'of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood', 'which must generally have led to imprudence.  She had', 'an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate,', 'and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern', 'them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;', 'and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.', \"Marianne's abilities were, in many respects,\", \"quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever;\", 'but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have', 'no moderation.  She was generous, amiable, interesting: she', 'was everything but prudent.  The resemblance between', 'her and her mother was strikingly great.', 'Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her', \"sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued\", 'and cherished.  They encouraged each other now in the', 'violence of their affliction.  The agony of grief', 'which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed,', 'was sought for, was created again and again.  They gave', 'themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase', 'of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it,', 'and resolved against ever admitting consolation', 'in future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still', 'she could struggle, she could exert herself.  She could', 'consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law', 'on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;', 'and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion,', 'and encourage her to similar forbearance.', 'Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored,', 'well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed', \"a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having\", 'much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair', 'to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.', 'CHAPTER 2', 'Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress', 'of Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded', 'to the condition of visitors.  As such, however, they were', 'treated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband', 'with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody', 'beyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really', 'pressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland', 'as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible', 'to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could', 'accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood,', 'his invitation was accepted.', 'A continuance in a place where everything reminded', 'her of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind.', 'In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful', 'than hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine', 'expectation of happiness which is happiness itself.', 'But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,', 'and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was', 'beyond alloy.', 'Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her', 'husband intended to do for his sisters.  To take three', 'thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy', 'would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree.', 'She begged him to think again on the subject.  How could', 'he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only', 'child too, of so large a sum?  And what possible claim', 'could the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by', 'half blood, which she considered as no relationship at all,', 'have on his generosity to so large an amount.  It was very', 'well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist', 'between the children of any man by different marriages;', 'and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry,', 'by giving away all his money to his half sisters?', '\"It was my father\\'s last request to me,\" replied', 'her husband, \"that I should assist his widow and daughters.\"', '\"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say;', 'ten to one but he was light-headed at the time.', 'Had he been in his right senses, he could not have thought', 'of such a thing as begging you to give away half your', 'fortune from your own child.\"', '\"He did not stipulate for any particular sum,', 'my dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms,', 'to assist them, and make their situation more comfortable', 'than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it would', 'have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.', 'He could hardly suppose I should neglect them.', 'But as he required the promise, I could not do less', 'than give it; at least I thought so at the time.', 'The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.', 'Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland', 'and settle in a new home.\"', '\"Well, then, LET something be done for them;', 'but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds.', 'Consider,\" she added, \"that when the money is once', 'parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters will marry,', 'and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could', 'be restored to our poor little boy--\"', '\"Why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely,', '\"that would make great difference.  The time may come when', 'Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with.', 'If he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would', 'be a very convenient addition.\"', '\"To be sure it would.\"', '\"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties,', 'if the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds', 'would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!\"', '\"Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth', 'would do half so much for his sisters, even if REALLY', 'his sisters!  And as it is--only half blood!--But you', 'have such a generous spirit!\"', '\"I would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied.', '\"One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than', 'too little.  No one, at least, can think I have not', 'done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly', 'expect more.\"', '\"There is no knowing what THEY may expect,\"', 'said the lady, \"but we are not to think of their', 'expectations: the question is, what you can afford to do.\"', '\"Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five', 'hundred pounds a-piece.  As it is, without any addition', 'of mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds', \"on their mother's death--a very comfortable fortune\", 'for any young woman.\"', '\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that', 'they can want no addition at all.  They will have ten', 'thousand pounds divided amongst them.  If they marry,', 'they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not,', 'they may all live very comfortably together on the interest', 'of ten thousand pounds.\"', '\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether,', 'upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do', 'something for their mother while she lives, rather than', 'for them--something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters', 'would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.', 'A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"', 'His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving', 'her consent to this plan.', '\"To be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with', 'fifteen hundred pounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood', 'should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in.\"', '\"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot', 'be worth half that purchase.\"', '\"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always', 'live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them;', 'and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.', 'An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over', 'and over every year, and there is no getting rid', 'of it.  You are not aware of what you are doing.', 'I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities;', 'for my mother was clogged with the payment of three', \"to old superannuated servants by my father's will,\", 'and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.', 'Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then', 'there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one', 'of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned', 'out to be no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.', 'Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual', 'claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father,', 'because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at', \"my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.\", 'It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am', 'sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for', 'all the world.\"', '\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood,', '\"to have those kind of yearly drains on one\\'s income.', \"One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one's own.\", 'To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,', 'on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away', 'one\\'s independence.\"', '\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.', 'They think themselves secure, you do no more than what', 'is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all.  If I were you,', 'whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely.', 'I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.', 'It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred,', 'or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"', '\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better', 'that there should by no annuity in the case; whatever I', 'may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance', 'than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge', 'their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income,', 'and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end', 'of the year.  It will certainly be much the best way.', 'A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent', 'their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think,', 'be amply discharging my promise to my father.\"', '\"To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth,', 'I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea', 'of your giving them any money at all.  The assistance', 'he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be', 'reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking', 'out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them', 'to move their things, and sending them presents of fish', 'and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season.', \"I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\", 'it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.', 'Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively', 'comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live', 'on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the', 'thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings', 'them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course,', 'they will pay their mother for their board out of it.', 'Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them,', 'and what on earth can four women want for more than', 'that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will', 'be nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses,', 'and hardly any servants; they will keep no company,', 'and can have no expenses of any kind!  Only conceive', 'how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a year! I am', 'sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it;', 'and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think', 'of it.  They will be much more able to give YOU something.\"', '\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you', 'are perfectly right.  My father certainly could mean', 'nothing more by his request to me than what you say.', 'I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil', 'my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness', 'to them as you have described.  When my mother removes', 'into another house my services shall be readily given', 'to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little present', 'of furniture too may be acceptable then.\"', '\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  \"But, however,', 'ONE thing must be considered.  When your father and mother', 'moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill', 'was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved,', 'and is now left to your mother.  Her house will therefore', 'be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"', '\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.', 'A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would', 'have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here.\"', '\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice', 'as handsome as what belongs to this house.  A great', 'deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY', 'can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.', 'Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this:', 'that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention', 'to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could,', 'he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM.\"', 'This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his', 'intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he', 'finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary,', 'if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow', 'and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly', 'acts as his own wife pointed out.', 'CHAPTER 3', 'Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months;', 'not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every', 'well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it', 'produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive,', 'and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that', 'of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances,', 'she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries', 'for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland;', 'for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.', 'But she could hear of no situation that at once answered', 'her notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence', 'of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected', 'several houses as too large for their income, which her', 'mother would have approved.', 'Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the', 'solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour,', 'which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections.', 'She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he', \"had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters'\", 'sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was', 'persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would', \"support her in affluence.  For their brother's sake, too,\", 'for the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she', 'reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before,', 'in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentive', 'behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that', 'their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time,', 'she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.', 'The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance,', 'felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased', 'by the farther knowledge of her character, which half', \"a year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps\", 'in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal', 'affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might', 'have found it impossible to have lived together so long,', 'had not a particular circumstance occurred to give', 'still greater eligibility, according to the opinions', \"of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.\", 'This circumstance was a growing attachment between', 'her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood,', 'a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced', \"to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment\", 'at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part', 'of his time there.', 'Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from', 'motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son', 'of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed', 'it from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum,', 'the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother.', 'But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration.', 'It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,', 'that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned', 'the partiality.  It was contrary to every doctrine of', \"her's that difference of fortune should keep any couple\", 'asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition;', \"and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged\", 'by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.', 'Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good', 'opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address.', 'He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy', 'to make them pleasing.  He was too diffident to do justice', 'to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,', 'his behaviour gave every indication of an open,', 'affectionate heart.  His understanding was good,', 'and his education had given it solid improvement.', 'But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition', 'to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed', 'to see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.', 'They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some', 'manner or other.  His mother wished to interest him in', 'political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see', 'him connected with some of the great men of the day.', 'Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while,', 'till one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would', 'have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche.', 'But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches.', 'All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet', 'of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brother', 'who was more promising.', 'Edward had been staying several weeks in the house', \"before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention;\", 'for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered', 'her careless of surrounding objects.  She saw only that he', 'was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.', 'He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by', 'ill-timed conversation.  She was first called to observe', 'and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor', 'chanced one day to make on the difference between him', 'and his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended him', 'most forcibly to her mother.', '\"It is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike', 'Fanny is enough.  It implies everything amiable.', 'I love him already.\"', '\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you', 'know more of him.\"', '\"Like him!\" replied her mother with a smile.', '\"I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love.\"', '\"You may esteem him.\"', '\"I have never yet known what it was to separate', 'esteem and love.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.', 'Her manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.', 'She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion', 'of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration;', 'but she really felt assured of his worth: and even that', 'quietness of manner, which militated against all her', \"established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be,\", 'was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be', 'warm and his temper affectionate.', 'No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love', 'in his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their', 'serious attachment as certain, and looked forward', 'to their marriage as rapidly approaching.', '\"In a few months, my dear Marianne.\" said she,', '\"Elinor will, in all probability be settled for life.', 'We shall miss her; but SHE will be happy.\"', '\"Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without her?\"', '\"My love, it will be scarcely a separation.', 'We shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall', 'meet every day of our lives.  You will gain a brother,', 'a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest opinion', \"in the world of Edward's heart.  But you look grave,\", 'Marianne; do you disapprove your sister\\'s choice?\"', '\"Perhaps,\" said Marianne, \"I may consider it', 'with some surprise.  Edward is very amiable, and I love', 'him tenderly.  But yet--he is not the kind of young', 'man--there is something wanting--his figure is not striking;', 'it has none of that grace which I should expect', 'in the man who could seriously attach my sister.', 'His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once', 'announce virtue and intelligence.  And besides all this,', 'I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste.  Music seems', \"scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's\", 'drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person', 'who can understand their worth.  It is evident, in spite of', 'his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact', 'he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as a lover,', 'not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters', 'must be united.  I could not be happy with a man whose', 'taste did not in every point coincide with my own.', 'He must enter into all my feelings; the same books,', 'the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how spiritless,', \"how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!\", 'I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it', 'with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.', 'I could hardly keep my seat.  To hear those beautiful lines', 'which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced', 'with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!\"--', '\"He would certainly have done more justice to', 'simple and elegant prose.  I thought so at the time;', 'but you WOULD give him Cowper.\"', '\"Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--', 'but we must allow for difference of taste.  Elinor has', 'not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and', 'be happy with him.  But it would have broke MY heart,', 'had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.', 'Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced', 'that I shall never see a man whom I can really love.', \"I require so much!  He must have all Edward's virtues,\", 'and his person and manners must ornament his goodness', 'with every possible charm.\"', '\"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.', 'It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness.', 'Why should you be less fortunate than your mother?  In', 'one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your destiny be', 'different from her\\'s!\"', 'CHAPTER 4', '\"What a pity it is, Elinor,\" said Marianne,', '\"that Edward should have no taste for drawing.\"', '\"No taste for drawing!\" replied Elinor, \"why should', 'you think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has', 'great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people,', 'and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste,', 'though he has not had opportunities of improving it.', 'Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would', 'have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment', 'in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling', 'to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate', 'propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general', 'direct him perfectly right.\"', 'Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more', 'on the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor', 'described as excited in him by the drawings of other', 'people, was very far from that rapturous delight, which,', 'in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though', 'smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured', 'her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.', '\"I hope, Marianne,\" continued Elinor, \"you do not', 'consider him as deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think', 'I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him', 'is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion,', 'I am sure you could never be civil to him.\"', 'Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would', 'not wound the feelings of her sister on any account,', 'and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible.', 'At length she replied:', '\"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him', 'is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.', 'I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter', 'propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes,', 'as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world', 'of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that is', 'worthy and amiable.\"', '\"I am sure,\" replied Elinor, with a smile,', '\"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied', 'with such commendation as that.  I do not perceive', 'how you could express yourself more warmly.\"', 'Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.', '\"Of his sense and his goodness,\" continued Elinor,', '\"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him', 'often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.', 'The excellence of his understanding and his principles', 'can be concealed only by that shyness which too often', 'keeps him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice', 'to his solid worth.  But of his minuter propensities,', 'as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances', 'been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I have', 'been at times thrown a good deal together, while you', 'have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate', 'principle by my mother.  I have seen a great deal of him,', 'have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on', 'subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,', 'I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed,', 'enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively,', 'his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate', 'and pure.  His abilities in every respect improve', 'as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.', 'At first sight, his address is certainly not striking;', 'and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the', 'expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good,', 'and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.', 'At present, I know him so well, that I think him', 'really handsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you,', 'Marianne?\"', '\"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I', 'do not now.  When you tell me to love him as a brother,', 'I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do', 'in his heart.\"', 'Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for', 'the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.', 'She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion.', 'She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required', \"greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction\", 'of their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that', 'what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment,', 'they believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope,', 'and to hope was to expect.  She tried to explain the real', 'state of the case to her sister.', '\"I do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that I think', 'very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"', 'Marianne here burst forth with indignation--', '\"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!', 'worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.', 'Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment.\"', 'Elinor could not help laughing.  \"Excuse me,\"', 'said she; \"and be assured that I meant no offence to you,', 'by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.', 'Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;', 'believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the', 'suspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant,', 'without imprudence or folly.  But farther than this you must', 'not believe.  I am by no means assured of his regard for me.', 'There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful;', 'and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder', 'at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality,', 'by believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart', 'I feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.', 'But there are other points to be considered besides', 'his inclination.  He is very far from being independent.', \"What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's\", 'occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have', 'never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very', 'much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there', 'would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish', 'to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or', 'high rank.\"', 'Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination', 'of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.', '\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she.', '\"Yet it certainly soon will happen.  But two advantages', 'will proceed from this delay.  I shall not lose you so soon,', 'and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving', 'that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must', 'be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.', 'Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to', 'learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!\"', 'Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.', 'She could not consider her partiality for Edward', 'in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it.', 'There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which,', 'if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost', 'as unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him', 'to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.', 'It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind', 'which frequently attended him.  A more reasonable cause', 'might be found in the dependent situation which forbade', 'the indulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother', 'neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable', 'at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form', 'a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views', 'for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge as this,', 'it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.', 'She was far from depending on that result of his preference', 'of her, which her mother and sister still considered', 'as certain.  Nay, the longer they were together the more', 'doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes,', 'for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more', 'than friendship.', 'But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough,', 'when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy,', 'and at the same time, (which was still more common,)', 'to make her uncivil.  She took the first opportunity of', 'affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to', \"her so expressively of her brother's great expectations,\", \"of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should\", 'marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman', 'who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could', 'neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.', 'She gave her an answer which marked her contempt,', 'and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might', 'be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal,', 'her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week', 'to such insinuations.', 'In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered', 'to her from the post, which contained a proposal', 'particularly well timed.  It was the offer of a small house,', 'on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own,', 'a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.', 'The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written', 'in the true spirit of friendly accommodation.', 'He understood that she was in need of a dwelling;', 'and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,', 'he assured her that everything should be done to it which', 'she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her.', 'He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars', 'of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to', 'Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence', 'she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the', 'houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration,', 'be made comfortable to her.  He seemed really anxious to', 'accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written', 'in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure', 'to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was', 'suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her', 'nearer connections.  She needed no time for deliberation', 'or inquiry.  Her resolution was formed as she read.', 'The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from', 'Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before,', 'would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every', 'possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its', 'first recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland', 'was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;', 'it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing', \"her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever\", 'from that beloved place would be less painful than to', 'inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.', 'She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment', 'of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;', 'and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters,', 'that she might be secure of their approbation before her', 'answer were sent.', 'Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent', 'for them to settle at some distance from Norland,', 'than immediately amongst their present acquaintance.', 'On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose', \"her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.\", 'The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so', 'simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate,', 'as to leave her no right of objection on either point;', 'and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought', 'any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from', 'the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made', 'no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter', 'of acquiescence.', 'CHAPTER 5', 'No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood', 'indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her', 'son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house,', 'and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were', 'ready for her inhabiting it.  They heard her with surprise.', 'Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly', 'hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.', 'She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going', 'into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her,', 'on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern,', 'which required no explanation to her, repeated,', '\"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there?  So far from hence!', 'And to what part of it?\"  She explained the situation.', 'It was within four miles northward of Exeter.', '\"It is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but I hope', 'to see many of my friends in it.  A room or two can', 'easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty', 'in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find', 'none in accommodating them.\"', 'She concluded with a very kind invitation to', 'Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton;', 'and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection.', 'Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had', 'made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than', 'was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect', 'on her in that point to which it principally tended.', 'To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her', 'object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood,', 'by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she', 'disregarded her disapprobation of the match.', 'Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again', 'how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at', 'such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any', 'service to her in removing her furniture.  He really felt', 'conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion', 'to which he had limited the performance of his promise to', 'his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.--', 'The furniture was all sent around by water.  It chiefly', 'consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,', \"with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.  Mrs. John\", 'Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could', \"not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income\", 'would be so trifling in comparison with their own,', 'she should have any handsome article of furniture.', 'Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was', 'ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession.', 'No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she', 'waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland,', 'and to determine her future household, before she set', 'off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid', 'in the performance of everything that interested her,', 'was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband', 'had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity', 'now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed', 'to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her', 'eldest daughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she', 'consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it;', 'but the discretion of Elinor prevailed.  HER wisdom', 'too limited the number of their servants to three;', 'two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided', 'from amongst those who had formed their establishment', 'at Norland.', 'The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately', \"into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's\", 'arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown', 'to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the', 'cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied', \"so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house,\", 'as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she', 'entered it as her own.  Her eagerness to be gone from Norland', 'was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction', 'of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal;', 'a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed', 'under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.', \"Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his\", 'father might with particular propriety be fulfilled.', 'Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to', 'the estate, their quitting his house might be looked', 'on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment.', 'But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every', 'hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general', 'drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no', 'farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.', 'He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses', 'of housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse,', 'which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond', 'calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand', 'in need of more money himself than to have any design of', 'giving money away.', 'In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir', \"John Middleton's first letter to Norland, every thing was\", 'so far settled in their future abode as to enable', 'Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.', 'Many were the tears shed by them in their last', 'adieus to a place so much beloved.  \"Dear, dear Norland!\"', 'said Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house,', 'on the last evening of their being there; \"when shall I cease', 'to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!', 'happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing', 'you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view', 'you no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you', 'will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we', 'are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we', 'can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same;', 'unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion,', 'and insensible of any change in those who walk under your', 'shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you?\"', 'CHAPTER 6', 'The first part of their journey was performed in too', 'melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious', 'and unpleasant.  But as they drew towards the end of it,', 'their interest in the appearance of a country which they', 'were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of', 'Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.', 'It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich', 'in pasture.  After winding along it for more than a mile,', 'they reached their own house.  A small green court was', 'the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate', 'admitted them into it.', 'As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable', 'and compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the', 'building was regular, the roof was tiled, the window', 'shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered', 'with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly through', 'the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the', 'entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square;', 'and beyond them were the offices and the stairs.', 'Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house.', 'It had not been built many years and was in good repair.', 'In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but', 'the tears which recollection called forth as they entered', 'the house were soon dried away.  They were cheered', 'by the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each', 'for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.', 'It was very early in September; the season was fine,', 'and from first seeing the place under the advantage', 'of good weather, they received an impression in its', 'favour which was of material service in recommending', 'it to their lasting approbation.', 'The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose', 'immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side;', 'some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.', 'The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills,', 'and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.', 'The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the', 'whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.', 'The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated', 'the valley in that direction; under another name,', 'and in another course, it branched out again between two', 'of the steepest of them.', 'With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood', 'was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former', 'style of life rendered many additions to the latter', 'indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her;', 'and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all', 'that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.', '\"As for the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is', 'too small for our family, but we will make ourselves', 'tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late', 'in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring,', 'if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may', 'think about building.  These parlors are both too small', 'for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often', 'collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the', 'passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other,', 'and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance;', 'this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added,', 'and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug', 'little cottage.  I could wish the stairs were handsome.', 'But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it', 'would be no difficult matter to widen them.  I shall see', 'how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring,', 'and we will plan our improvements accordingly.\"', 'In the mean time, till all these alterations could', 'be made from the savings of an income of five hundred', 'a-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were', 'wise enough to be contented with the house as it was;', 'and each of them was busy in arranging their particular', 'concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books', 'and other possessions, to form themselves a home.', \"Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of;\", \"and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls of their\", 'sitting room.', 'In such employments as these they were interrupted', 'soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of', 'their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton,', 'and to offer them every accommodation from his own house', 'and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.', 'Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.', 'He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long', 'for his young cousins to remember him.  His countenance', 'was thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were', 'as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrival', 'seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort', 'to be an object of real solicitude to him.  He said much', 'of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable', 'terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially', 'to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better', 'settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried', 'to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could', 'not give offence.  His kindness was not confined to words;', 'for within an hour after he left them, a large basket', 'full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park,', 'which was followed before the end of the day by a present', 'of game.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their', 'letters to and from the post for them, and would not be', 'denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper', 'every day.', 'Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him,', 'denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as', 'she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience;', 'and as this message was answered by an invitation', 'equally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.', 'They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on', 'whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the', 'elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes.', 'Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty;', 'her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,', 'and her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegance', \"which her husband's wanted.  But they would have been\", 'improved by some share of his frankness and warmth;', 'and her visit was long enough to detract something from', 'their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly', 'well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say', 'for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.', 'Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John', 'was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise', 'precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine', 'little boy about six years old, by which means there was', 'one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case', 'of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age,', 'admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother', 'answered for him, while he hung about her and held', 'down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship,', 'who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he', 'could make noise enough at home.  On every formal visit', 'a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision', 'for discourse.  In the present case it took up ten minutes', 'to determine whether the boy were most like his father', 'or mother, and in what particular he resembled either,', 'for of course every body differed, and every body was', 'astonished at the opinion of the others.', 'An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods', 'of debating on the rest of the children, as Sir John', 'would not leave the house without securing their promise', 'of dining at the park the next day.', 'CHAPTER 7', 'Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.', 'The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley,', 'but it was screened from their view at home by the', 'projection of a hill.  The house was large and handsome;', 'and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality', \"and elegance.  The former was for Sir John's gratification,\", 'the latter for that of his lady.  They were scarcely', 'ever without some friends staying with them in the house,', 'and they kept more company of every kind than any other', 'family in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary to the', 'happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper', 'and outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other', 'in that total want of talent and taste which confined', 'their employments, unconnected with such as society produced,', 'within a very narrow compass.  Sir John was a sportsman,', 'Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and she', 'humoured her children; and these were their only resources.', 'Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her', \"children all the year round, while Sir John's independent\", 'employments were in existence only half the time.', 'Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,', 'supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education;', 'supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise', 'to the good breeding of his wife.', 'Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance', 'of her table, and of all her domestic arrangements;', 'and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment', \"in any of their parties.  But Sir John's satisfaction\", 'in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting', 'about him more young people than his house would hold,', 'and the noisier they were the better was he pleased.', 'He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood,', 'for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold', 'ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private', 'balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not', 'suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.', 'The arrival of a new family in the country was always', 'a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was', 'charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his', 'cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty,', 'and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his good opinion;', 'for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could', 'want to make her mind as captivating as her person.', 'The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in', 'accommodating those, whose situation might be considered,', 'in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  In showing', 'kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction', 'of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only', 'in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman;', 'for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who', 'are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging', 'their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own', 'manor.', 'Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door', 'of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton', 'Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them', 'to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern', 'which the same subject had drawn from him the day before,', 'at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.', 'They would see, he said, only one gentleman there', 'besides himself; a particular friend who was staying at', 'the park, but who was neither very young nor very gay.', 'He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party,', 'and could assure them it should never happen so again.', 'He had been to several families that morning in hopes', 'of procuring some addition to their number, but it', 'was moonlight and every body was full of engagements.', \"Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton\", 'within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful', 'agreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find', 'it so very dull as they might imagine.  The young ladies,', 'as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with', 'having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for', 'no more.', \"Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a\", 'good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a', 'great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar.  She was full', 'of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said', 'many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands;', 'hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,', 'and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.', \"Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned\", 'her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks,', 'with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than', \"could arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings's.\", 'Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no', 'more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend,', 'than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings', \"to be Lady Middleton's mother.  He was silent and grave.\", 'His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite', 'of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret', 'an absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side', 'of five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome,', 'his countenance was sensible, and his address was', 'particularly gentlemanlike.', 'There was nothing in any of the party which could', 'recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold', 'insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive,', 'that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon,', 'and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his', 'mother-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed', 'to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her', 'four noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about,', 'tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse', 'except what related to themselves.', 'In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical,', 'she was invited to play.  The instrument was unlocked,', 'every body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne,', 'who sang very well, at their request went through the', 'chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into', 'the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain', 'ever since in the same position on the pianoforte,', 'for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving', \"up music, although by her mother's account, she had\", 'played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.', \"Marianne's performance was highly applauded.\", 'Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song,', 'and as loud in his conversation with the others while every', 'song lasted.  Lady Middleton frequently called him to order,', \"wondered how any one's attention could be diverted from music\", 'for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song', 'which Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone,', 'of all the party, heard her without being in raptures.', 'He paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt', 'a respect for him on the occasion, which the others had', 'reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste.', 'His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that', 'ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,', 'was estimable when contrasted against the horrible', 'insensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough', 'to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have', 'outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite', 'power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make', \"every allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life\", 'which humanity required.', 'CHAPTER 8', 'Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.', 'She had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived', 'to see respectably married, and she had now therefore', 'nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world.', 'In the promotion of this object she was zealously active,', 'as far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity', 'of projecting weddings among all the young people', 'of her acquaintance.  She was remarkably quick in the', 'discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage', 'of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young', 'lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man;', 'and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her', 'arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel', 'Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood.', 'She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first', 'evening of their being together, from his listening', 'so attentively while she sang to them; and when the visit', \"was returned by the Middletons' dining at the cottage,\", 'the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.', 'It must be so.  She was perfectly convinced of it.', 'It would be an excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE', 'was handsome.  Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see', 'Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection', 'with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;', 'and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every', 'pretty girl.', 'The immediate advantage to herself was by no means', 'inconsiderable, for it supplied her with endless jokes', 'against them both.  At the park she laughed at the colonel,', 'and in the cottage at Marianne.  To the former her', 'raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,', 'perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at', 'first incomprehensible; and when its object was understood,', 'she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity,', 'or censure its impertinence, for she considered it as an', \"unfeeling reflection on the colonel's advanced years,\", 'and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.', 'Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years', 'younger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared', 'to the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear', 'Mrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw', 'ridicule on his age.', '\"But at least, Mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity', 'of the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally', 'ill-natured.  Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than', 'Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY father;', 'and if he were ever animated enough to be in love,', 'must have long outlived every sensation of the kind.', 'It is too ridiculous!  When is a man to be safe from such wit,', 'if age and infirmity will not protect him?\"', '\"Infirmity!\" said Elinor, \"do you call Colonel Brandon', 'infirm?  I can easily suppose that his age may appear much', 'greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly', 'deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!\"', '\"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?', 'and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?\"', '\"My dearest child,\" said her mother, laughing,', '\"at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay;', 'and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been', 'extended to the advanced age of forty.\"', '\"Mamma, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well', 'that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends', 'yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature.', 'He may live twenty years longer.  But thirty-five has', 'nothing to do with matrimony.\"', '\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, \"thirty-five and seventeen had', 'better not have any thing to do with matrimony together.', 'But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman', 'who is single at seven and twenty, I should not think', \"Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to his\", 'marrying HER.\"', '\"A woman of seven and twenty,\" said Marianne,', 'after pausing a moment, \"can never hope to feel or inspire', 'affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable,', 'or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might', 'bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse,', 'for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.', 'In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be', 'nothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact of convenience,', 'and the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would', 'be no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.', 'To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which', 'each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other.\"', '\"It would be impossible, I know,\" replied Elinor,', '\"to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could', 'feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough', 'to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.', 'But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and', 'his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber,', 'merely because he chanced to complain yesterday (a', 'very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one', 'of his shoulders.\"', '\"But he talked of flannel waistcoats,\" said Marianne;', '\"and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected', 'with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of', 'ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble.\"', '\"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not', 'have despised him half so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not', 'there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek,', 'hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?\"', \"Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room,\", '\"Mamma,\" said Marianne, \"I have an alarm on the subject', 'of illness which I cannot conceal from you.

Nothing but real', 'indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.', 'What else can detain him at Norland?\"', '\"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?\"', 'said Mrs. Dashwood.  \"I had none.  On the contrary,', 'if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has', 'been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want', 'of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation,', 'when I talked of his coming to Barton.

How cold, how composed were their last', 'adieus! How languid their conversation the last evening', \"of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was no\", 'distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes', 'of an affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave', 'them purposely together in the course of the last morning,', 'and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out', 'of the room.  And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward,', 'cried not as I did.  Even now her self-command is invariable.', 'When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try', 'to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied', 'in it?\"', 'CHAPTER 9', 'The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable', 'comfort to themselves.  The house and the garden, with all', 'the objects surrounding them, were now become familiar,', 'and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland', 'half its charms were engaged in again with far greater', 'enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the', 'loss of their father.  Sir John Middleton, who called', 'on them every day for the first fortnight, and who was', 'not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home,', 'could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.', 'Their visitors, except those from Barton Park,', \"were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties\", 'that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated', 'assurances of his carriage being always at their service,', \"the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the\", 'wish of society for her children; and she was resolute', 'in declining to visit any family beyond the distance', 'of a walk.  There were but few who could be so classed;', 'and it was not all of them that were attainable.', 'About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow', 'winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton,', 'as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their', 'earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking', 'mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland,', 'interested their imagination and made them wish to be', 'better acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry,', 'that its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character,', 'was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world,', 'and never stirred from home.', 'The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.', 'The high downs which invited them from almost every window', 'of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air', 'on their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt', 'of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties;', 'and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret', 'one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the', 'partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear', 'the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding', 'days had occasioned.  The weather was not tempting enough', 'to draw the two others from their pencil and their book,', \"in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would\", 'be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would', 'be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off', 'together.', 'They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own', 'penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they', 'caught in their faces the animating gales of a high', 'south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented', 'their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.', '\"Is there a felicity in the world,\" said Marianne,', '\"superior to this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least', 'two hours.\"', 'Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against', 'the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about', 'twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over', 'their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.--', 'Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly,', 'to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house.', 'One consolation however remained for them, to which the', 'exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety;', 'it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep', 'side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.', 'They set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage,', 'but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground;', 'and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her,', 'was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom', 'in safety.', 'A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers', 'playing round him, was passing up the hill and within', 'a few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened.', 'He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  She had', 'raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been', 'twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.', 'The gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her', 'modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary,', 'took her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried', 'her down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,', 'the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her', 'directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived,', 'and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair', 'in the parlour.', 'Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at', 'their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed', 'on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration', 'which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized', 'for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner', 'so frank and so graceful that his person, which was', 'uncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice', 'and expression.  Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar,', 'the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would', 'have been secured by any act of attention to her child;', 'but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance,', 'gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings.', 'She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness', 'of address which always attended her, invited him to', 'be seated.  But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet.', 'Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged.', 'His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present', 'home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would', 'allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire', 'after Miss Dashwood.  The honour was readily granted,', 'and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,', 'in the midst of a heavy rain.', 'His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness', 'were instantly the theme of general admiration,', 'and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne', 'received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.--', 'Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest,', 'for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his', 'lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding', 'him after their entering the house.  But she had seen', 'enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others,', 'and with an energy which always adorned her praise.', 'His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever', 'drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying', 'her into the house with so little previous formality, there', 'was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended', 'the action to her.  Every circumstance belonging to him', 'was interesting.  His name was good, his residence was in', 'their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all', 'manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.', 'Her imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant,', 'and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.', 'Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval', 'of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out', \"of doors; and Marianne's accident being related to him,\", 'he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman', 'of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.', '\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is HE', 'in the country? That is good news however; I will', 'ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday.\"', '\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.', '\"Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here', 'every year.\"', '\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"', '\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.', 'A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider', 'in England.\"', '\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne,', 'indignantly.  \"But what are his manners on more intimate', 'acquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?\"', 'Sir John was rather puzzled.', '\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him', 'as to all THAT.  But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow,', 'and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer', 'I ever saw.  Was she out with him today?\"', 'But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the', \"colour of Mr. Willoughby's pointer, than he could\", 'describe to her the shades of his mind.', '\"But who is he?\" said Elinor.  \"Where does he come', 'from?  Has he a house at Allenham?\"', 'On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence;', 'and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property', 'of his own in the country; that he resided there only', 'while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court,', 'to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was', 'to inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth', 'catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty', 'little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides;', 'and if I were you, I would not give him up to my', 'younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.', 'Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.', 'Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care.\"', '\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a', 'good humoured smile, \"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded', 'by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what', 'you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment to which', 'they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us,', 'let them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however,', 'from what you say, that he is a respectable young man,', 'and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible.\"', '\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe,', 'as ever lived,\" repeated Sir John.  \"I remember', 'last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced', 'from eight o\\'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"', '\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes,', '\"and with elegance, with spirit?\"', '\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"', '\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought', 'to be.  Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them', 'should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue.\"', '\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see', 'how it will be.  You will be setting your cap at him now,', 'and never think of poor Brandon.\"', '\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne,', 'warmly, \"which I particularly dislike.  I abhor every', \"common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and 'setting\", \"one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,' are the most\", 'odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal;', 'and if their construction could ever be deemed clever,', 'time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity.\"', 'Sir John did not much understand this reproof;', 'but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,', '\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say,', 'one way or other.  Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already,', 'and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can', 'tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining', 'of ankles.\"', 'CHAPTER 10', \"Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance\", 'than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage', 'early the next morning to make his personal enquiries.', 'He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness;', \"with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her own\", 'gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during', 'the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance,', 'mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family', 'to whom accident had now introduced him.  Of their', 'personal charms he had not required a second interview', 'to be convinced.', 'Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion,', 'regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.', 'Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form, though not so', \"correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of height,\", 'was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when', 'in the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl,', 'truth was less violently outraged than usually happens.', 'Her skin was very brown, but, from its transparency,', 'her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features', 'were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive;', 'and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life,', 'a spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen', 'without delight.  From Willoughby their expression was at', 'first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance', 'of his assistance created.  But when this passed away,', 'when her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the', 'perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness', 'and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,', 'that of music and dancing he was passionately fond,', 'she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the', 'largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest', 'of his stay.', 'It was only necessary to mention any favourite', 'amusement to engage her to talk.  She could not be', 'silent when such points were introduced, and she', 'had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.', 'They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing', 'and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general', 'conformity of judgment in all that related to either.', 'Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,', 'she proceeded to question him on the subject of books;', 'her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt', 'upon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of', 'five and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to', 'become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works,', 'however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly alike.', 'The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--', 'or if any difference appeared, any objection arose,', 'it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments', 'and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.', 'He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm;', 'and long before his visit concluded, they conversed', 'with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.', '\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them,', '\"for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well.', \"You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in\", 'almost every matter of importance.  You know what he thinks', 'of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating', 'their beauties as he ought, and you have received every', 'assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.', 'But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such', 'extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?', 'You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.', 'Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments', 'on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then', 'you can have nothing farther to ask.\"--', '\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this', 'just? are my ideas so scanty?  But I see what you mean.', 'I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank.', 'I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum;', 'I have been open and sincere where I ought to have', 'been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had', 'I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I', 'spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have', 'been spared.\"', '\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended', 'with Elinor--she was only in jest.  I should scold', 'her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check', 'the delight of your conversation with our new friend.\"--', 'Marianne was softened in a moment.', 'Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his', 'pleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish', 'of improving it could offer.  He came to them every day.', 'To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the', 'encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave', 'greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it', \"had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.\", 'She was confined for some days to the house; but never had', 'any confinement been less irksome.  Willoughby was a young', 'man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits,', 'and open, affectionate manners.  He was exactly formed', \"to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined\", 'not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour', 'of mind which was now roused and increased by the example', 'of her own, and which recommended him to her affection', 'beyond every thing else.', 'His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.', 'They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical', 'talents were considerable; and he read with all the', 'sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.', \"In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless\", \"as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him\", 'but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly', 'delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on', 'every occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.', 'In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people,', 'in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment', 'of undivided attention where his heart was engaged,', 'and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety,', 'he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve,', 'in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.', 'Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation', 'which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever', 'seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection,', 'had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was all', 'that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour', 'and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her;', 'and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect', 'as earnest, as his abilities were strong.', 'Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative', 'thought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect', 'of riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and', 'expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having', 'gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.', \"Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had\", 'so early been discovered by his friends, now first became', 'perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed', 'by them.  Their attention and wit were drawn off to his', 'more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other', 'had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed', 'when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule', 'so justly annexed to sensibility.  Elinor was obliged,', 'though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which', 'Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction,', 'were now actually excited by her sister; and that however', 'a general resemblance of disposition between the parties', 'might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally', 'striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the', 'regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;', 'for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope,', 'when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as', 'she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished', 'him indifferent.  She liked him--in spite of his gravity', 'and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.', 'His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve', 'appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits', 'than of any natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John', 'had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments,', 'which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man,', 'and she regarded him with respect and compassion.', 'Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more', 'because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne,', 'who, prejudiced against him for being neither lively', 'nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.', '\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby', 'one day, when they were talking of him together,', '\"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about;', 'whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers', 'to talk to.\"', '\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.', '\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it', 'is injustice in both of you.  He is highly esteemed', 'by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself', 'without taking pains to converse with him.\"', '\"That he is patronised by YOU,\" replied Willoughby,', '\"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem', 'of the others, it is a reproach in itself.  Who would', 'submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman', 'as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command', 'the indifference of any body else?\"', '\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself', 'and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady', 'Middleton and her mother.  If their praise is censure,', 'your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning,', 'than you are prejudiced and unjust.\"', '\"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.\"', '\"My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man;', 'and sense will always have attractions for me.', 'Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.', 'He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,', 'has read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him', 'capable of giving me much information on various subjects;', 'and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of', 'good-breeding and good nature.\"', '\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously,', '\"he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot,', 'and the mosquitoes are troublesome.\"', '\"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made', 'any such inquiries, but they happened to be points', 'on which I had been previously informed.\"', '\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may', 'have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs,', 'and palanquins.\"', '\"I may venture to say that HIS observations', 'have stretched much further than your candour.', 'But why should you dislike him?\"', '\"I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary,', \"as a very respectable man, who has every body's good word,\", \"and nobody's notice; who, has more money than he can spend,\", 'more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats', 'every year.\"', '\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has', 'neither genius, taste, nor spirit.  That his understanding', 'has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice', 'no expression.\"', '\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\"', 'replied Elinor, \"and so much on the strength of your', 'own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give', 'of him is comparatively cold and insipid.  I can only', 'pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed,', 'of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart.\"', '\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using', 'me unkindly.  You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason,', 'and to convince me against my will.  But it will not do.', 'You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful.  I have', 'three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon;', 'he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine;', 'he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle,', 'and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.  If it', 'will be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told,', 'that I believe his character to be in other respects', 'irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return', 'for an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain,', 'you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much', 'as ever.\"', 'CHAPTER 11', 'Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined', 'when they first came into Devonshire, that so many', 'engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly', 'presented themselves, or that they should have such frequent', 'invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little', 'leisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.', 'When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home', 'and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming,', 'were put into execution.  The private balls at the park', 'then began; and parties on the water were made and', 'accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.', 'In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included;', 'and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended', 'these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing', 'intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford', 'him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne,', 'of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,', 'in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance', 'of her affection.', 'Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.', 'She only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once', 'or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some', 'self-command to Marianne.  But Marianne abhorred all', 'concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;', 'and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not', 'in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely', 'an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection', 'of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.', 'Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at', 'all times, was an illustration of their opinions.', 'When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.', 'Every thing he did, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.', 'If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards,', 'he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get', 'her a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusement', 'of the night, they were partners for half the time;', 'and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances,', 'were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word', 'to any body else.  Such conduct made them of course', 'most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame,', 'and seemed hardly to provoke them.', 'Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with', 'a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this', 'excessive display of them.  To her it was but the natural', 'consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.', 'This was the season of happiness to Marianne.', 'Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment', 'to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex,', 'was more likely to be softened than she had thought it', 'possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed', 'on her present home.', \"Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not\", 'so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements', 'so pure.  They afforded her no companion that could make', 'amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach', 'her to think of Norland with less regret than ever.', 'Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply', 'to her the conversation she missed; although the latter', 'was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded', 'her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of', 'her discourse.  She had already repeated her own history', \"to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been\", 'equal to her means of improvement, she might have known', 'very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of', \"Mr. Jenning's last illness, and what he said to his wife\", 'a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton was more', 'agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.', 'Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her', 'reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense', 'had nothing to do.  Towards her husband and mother she', 'was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore', 'neither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing', 'to say one day that she had not said the day before.', 'Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were', 'always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties', 'arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted', 'in style and her two eldest children attended her,', 'she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them', 'than she might have experienced in sitting at home;--', 'and so little did her presence add to the pleasure', 'of the others, by any share in their conversation,', 'that they were sometimes only reminded of her being', 'amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.', 'In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance,', 'did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the', 'respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship,', 'or give pleasure as a companion.  Willoughby was out', 'of the question.  Her admiration and regard, even her', 'sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover;', \"his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less\", 'agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.', 'Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such', 'encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing', 'with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the', 'indifference of her sister.', \"Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason\", 'to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already', 'been known to him.  This suspicion was given by some words', 'which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park,', 'when they were sitting down together by mutual consent,', 'while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed', 'on Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes,', 'he said, with a faint smile, \"Your sister, I understand,', 'does not approve of second attachments.\"', '\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"', '\"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them', 'impossible to exist.\"', '\"I believe she does.  But how she contrives it', 'without reflecting on the character of her own father,', 'who had himself two wives, I know not.  A few years', 'however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis', 'of common sense and observation; and then they may be', 'more easy to define and to justify than they now are,', 'by any body but herself.\"', '\"This will probably be the case,\" he replied;', '\"and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices', 'of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way', 'to the reception of more general opinions.\"', '\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor.', '\"There are inconveniences attending such feelings', \"as Marianne's, which all the charms of enthusiasm and\", 'ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her systems have', 'all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought;', 'and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look', 'forward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"', 'After a short pause he resumed the conversation', 'by saying,--', '\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections', 'against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal', 'in every body?  Are those who have been disappointed', 'in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy', 'of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances,', 'to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"', '\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae', 'of her principles.  I only know that I never yet heard her', 'admit any instance of a second attachment\\'s being pardonable.\"', '\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change,', 'a total change of sentiments--No, no, do not desire it;', 'for when the romantic refinements of a young mind', 'are obliged to give way, how frequently are they', 'succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too', 'dangerous!  I speak from experience.  I once knew a lady', 'who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister,', 'who thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced', 'change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"--', 'Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said', 'too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,', \"which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head.\", 'The lady would probably have passed without suspicion,', 'had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned', 'her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was,', 'it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his', 'emotion with the tender recollection of past regard.', 'Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne, in her place,', 'would not have done so little.  The whole story would', 'have been speedily formed under her active imagination;', 'and every thing established in the most melancholy order', 'of disastrous love.', 'CHAPTER 12', 'As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the', 'next morning the latter communicated a piece of news', 'to her sister, which in spite of all that she knew', \"before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,\", 'surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.', 'Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that', 'Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred', 'himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was', 'exactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering', \"that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse,\", 'that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of', 'this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and', 'keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable', 'to receive them, she had accepted the present without', 'hesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.', '\"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire', 'immediately for it,\" she added, \"and when it arrives we', 'will ride every day.  You shall share its use with me.', 'Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop', 'on some of these downs.\"', 'Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of', 'felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended', 'the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them.', 'As to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle;', 'Mamma she was sure would never object to it; and any horse', 'would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park;', 'as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.', 'Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving', 'such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately', 'known to her.  This was too much.', '\"You are mistaken, Elinor,\" said she warmly,', '\"in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.', 'I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better', 'acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature', 'in the world, except yourself and mama.  It is not', 'time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--', 'it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be insufficient', 'to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven', 'days are more than enough for others.

The carriages were then ordered;', \"Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never looked\", 'happier than when she got into it.

I value not her', 'censure any more than I should do her commendation.', 'I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking', \"over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.\", 'They will one day be Mr. Willoughby\\'s, and--\"', '\"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne,', 'you would not be justified in what you have done.\"', 'She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly', \"gratifying to her; and after a ten minutes' interval of\", 'earnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said', 'with great good humour, \"Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS rather', 'ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted', 'particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house,', 'I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room', 'up stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use,', 'and with modern furniture it would be delightful.', 'It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.', 'On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind', 'the house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you', 'have a view of the church and village, and, beyond them,', 'of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired.', 'I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be', 'more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly', 'fitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says,', 'would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms', 'in England.\"', 'Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption', 'from the others, she would have described every room', 'in the house with equal delight.', 'CHAPTER 14', \"The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit\", 'at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause,', 'filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings', 'for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every', 'one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the', 'comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered,', 'with little intermission what could be the reason of it;', 'was sure there must be some bad news, and thought over', 'every kind of distress that could have befallen him,', 'with a fixed determination that he should not escape', 'them all.', '\"Something very melancholy must be the matter,', 'I am sure,\" said she.  \"I could see it in his face.', 'Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances may be bad.', 'The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand', 'a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.', 'I do think he must have been sent for about money matters,', 'for what else can it be?  I wonder whether it is so.', 'I would give anything to know the truth of it.  Perhaps it', 'is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is,', 'because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.', 'May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely,', 'for I have a notion she is always rather sickly.', 'I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams.', 'It is not so very likely he should be distressed in', 'his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man,', 'and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time.', 'I wonder what it can be!  May be his sister is worse', 'at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting off', 'in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out', 'of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into', 'the bargain.\"', 'So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion', 'varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming', 'equally probable as they arose.  Elinor, though she felt', 'really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon,', 'could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly', 'away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling;', 'for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion', 'justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation,', 'her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was engrossed', 'by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby', 'on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly', 'interesting to them all.  As this silence continued,', 'every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible', 'with the disposition of both.  Why they should not openly', 'acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant', 'behaviour to each other declared to have taken place,', 'Elinor could not imagine.', 'She could easily conceive that marriage might not', 'be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby', 'was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.', 'His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven', 'hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income', 'could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained', 'of his poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy', 'maintained by them relative to their engagement, which', 'in fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account;', 'and it was so wholly contradictory to their general', 'opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered', 'her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt', 'was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.', 'Nothing could be more expressive of attachment', \"to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour.  To Marianne\", \"it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's\", 'heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the', 'affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The cottage', 'seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home;', 'many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham;', 'and if no general engagement collected them at the park,', 'the exercise which called him out in the morning was', 'almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day', 'was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his', 'favourite pointer at her feet.', 'One evening in particular, about a week after', 'Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed', 'more than usually open to every feeling of attachment', \"to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's\", 'happening to mention her design of improving the cottage', 'in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration', 'of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.', '\"What!\" he exclaimed--\"Improve this dear cottage!', 'No. THAT I will never consent to.  Not a stone must', 'be added to its walls, not an inch to its size,', 'if my feelings are regarded.\"', '\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood,', '\"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother', 'will never have money enough to attempt it.\"', '\"I am heartily glad of it,\" he cried.  \"May she', 'always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better.\"', '\"Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I', 'would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment', 'of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements', 'in the world.  Depend upon it that whatever unemployed', 'sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring,', 'I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose', 'of it in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really', 'so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?\"', '\"I am,\" said he.  \"To me it is faultless.  Nay, more,', 'I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness', 'is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull', 'Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this', 'cottage.\"', '\"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes,', 'I suppose,\" said Elinor.', '\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all', 'and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience', 'or INconvenience about it, should the least variation', 'be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under such a roof, I', 'might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton.\"', '\"I flatter myself,\" replied Elinor, \"that even under', 'the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase,', 'you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you', 'now do this.\"', '\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby,', '\"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will', 'always have one claim of my affection, which no other can', 'possibly share.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne,', 'whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby,', 'as plainly denoted how well she understood him.', '\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at', 'Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were', 'inhabited!  I never passed within view of it without admiring', 'its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it.', 'How little did I then think that the very first news', 'I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into', 'the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I', 'felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event,', 'which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I', 'should experience from it, can account for.  Must it not have', 'been so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered voice.', 'Then continuing his former tone, he said, \"And yet this', 'house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it', 'of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear', 'parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which', 'so many happy hours have been since spent by us together,', 'you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,', 'and every body would be eager to pass through the room', 'which has hitherto contained within itself more real', 'accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of', 'the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration', 'of the kind should be attempted.', '\"You are a good woman,\" he warmly replied.', '\"Your promise makes me easy.  Extend it a little farther,', 'and it will make me happy.  Tell me that not only your', 'house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find', 'you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you', 'will always consider me with the kindness which has made', 'everything belonging to you so dear to me.\"', \"The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's\", 'behaviour during the whole of the evening declared', 'at once his affection and happiness.', '\"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?\" said Mrs. Dashwood,', 'when he was leaving them.  \"I do not ask you to come in', 'the morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady', 'Middleton.\"', \"He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.\", 'CHAPTER 15', \"Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place\", 'the next day, and two of her daughters went with her;', 'but Marianne excused herself from being of the party,', 'under some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother,', 'who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby', 'the night before of calling on her while they were absent,', 'was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home.', \"On their return from the park they found Willoughby's\", 'curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage,', 'and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture', 'had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;', 'but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight', 'had taught her to expect.  They were no sooner in the', 'passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour', 'apparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief', 'at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.', 'Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room', 'she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby,', 'who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back', 'towards them.  He turned round on their coming in,', 'and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook', 'of the emotion which over-powered Marianne.', '\"Is anything the matter with her?\" cried Mrs. Dashwood', 'as she entered--\"is she ill?\"', '\"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful;', 'and with a forced smile presently added, \"It is I who may', 'rather expect to be ill--for I am now suffering under a', 'very heavy disappointment!\"', '\"Disappointment?\"', '\"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.', 'Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege', 'of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on', 'business to London.

But Mrs. Smith must', 'be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from', 'us long I hope.\"', 'He coloured as he replied, \"You are very kind, but I', 'have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately.', 'My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within', 'the twelvemonth.\"', '\"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only', 'house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?', 'For shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?\"', 'His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed', 'on the ground he only replied, \"You are too good.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.', 'Elinor felt equal amazement.

Mrs. Dashwood first spoke.', '\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at', 'Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not', 'press you to return here immediately, because you only', 'can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith;', 'and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question', 'your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"', '\"My engagements at present,\" replied Willoughby,', 'confusedly, \"are of such a nature--that--I dare not flatter', 'myself\"--', 'He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished', 'to speak, and another pause succeeded.  This was broken', 'by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, \"It is folly', 'to linger in this manner.  I will not torment myself', 'any longer by remaining among friends whose society', 'it is impossible for me now to enjoy.\"', 'He then hastily took leave of them all and left', 'the room.  They saw him step into his carriage,', 'and in a minute it was out of sight.', 'Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly', 'quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern', 'and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.', \"Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.\", 'She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.', \"Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them, his\", 'embarrassment,', 'and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his', 'unwillingness', \"to accept her mother's invitation, a backwardness so unlike a\", 'lover,', 'so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared', 'that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the', 'next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him', 'and', 'her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room', 'was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for,', \"though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was,\", 'a quarrel seemed almost impossible.', 'But whatever might be the particulars of their separation,', \"her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought\", 'with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow', 'which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving', 'way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.', 'In about half an hour her mother returned, and though', 'her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.', '\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\"', 'said she, as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart', 'does he travel?\"', '\"It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It', 'seems but the work of a moment.  And last night he was', 'with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?  And now,', 'after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without intending', 'to return!--Something more than what be owned to us must', 'have happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave', 'like himself.  YOU must have seen the difference as well as I.', 'What can it be?  Can they have quarrelled?  Why else should he', 'have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?\"--', '\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could', 'plainly see THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.', 'I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can', 'perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed', 'strange to me as well as to you.\"', '\"Can you, indeed!\"', '\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most', 'satisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, who love to doubt', 'where you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you', 'shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am persuaded', 'that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,', 'disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views', 'for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--', 'and that the business which she sends him off to transact', 'is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.  This is what I', 'believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that she', 'DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore', 'at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne,', 'and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation,', 'to give into her schemes, and absent himself from', 'Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,', 'that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen', 'to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method', 'of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this.', 'And now, Elinor, what have you to say?\"', '\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"', '\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not', 'have happened.  Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your', 'feelings!  You had rather take evil upon credit than good.', 'You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt', 'for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter.', 'You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took', 'leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour', 'has shewn.  And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,', 'or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?  Are', 'no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they', 'are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we', 'have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world', 'to think ill of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable', 'in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?  And,', 'after all, what is it you suspect him of?\"', '\"I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of', 'something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence', 'of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him.', 'There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged', 'of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it', 'is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body.', 'Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient', 'reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.', 'But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge', 'them at once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I', 'cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him.\"', '\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from', 'his character, where the deviation is necessary.', 'But you really do admit the justice of what I have said', 'in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"', '\"Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their', 'engagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--', 'and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient', 'for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present.', 'But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"', '\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse', 'Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange', 'indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day', 'for incautiousness.\"', '\"I want no proof of their affection,\" said Elinor;', '\"but of their engagement I do.\"', '\"I am perfectly satisfied of both.\"', '\"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the', 'subject, by either of them.\"', '\"I have not wanted syllables where actions have', 'spoken so plainly.  Has not his behaviour to Marianne', 'and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight,', 'declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife,', 'and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest', 'relation?  Have we not perfectly understood each other?', 'Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner,', 'his attentive and affectionate respect?  My Elinor,', 'is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How could', 'such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed', 'that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your', \"sister's love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps\", 'for months, without telling her of his affection;--that', 'they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?\"', '\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance', 'except ONE is in favour of their engagement;', 'but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject,', 'and with me it almost outweighs every other.\"', '\"How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed', 'of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them,', 'you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together.', 'Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister', 'all this time?  Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?\"', '\"No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her', 'I am sure.\"', '\"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can', 'leave her with such indifference, such carelessness', 'of the future, as you attribute to him.\"', '\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never', 'considered this matter as certain.  I have had my doubts,', 'I confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they', 'may soon be entirely done away.  If we find they correspond,', 'every fear of mine will be removed.\"', '\"A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see', 'them at the altar, you would suppose they were going to', 'be married.  Ungracious girl!  But I require no such proof.', 'Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt;', 'no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open', \"and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.\", 'It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?', 'Is he not a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any', 'inconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?\"', '\"I hope not, I believe not,\" cried Elinor.', '\"I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his', 'integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me.', 'It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it.', 'I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his', 'manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself,', 'and did not return your kindness with any cordiality.', 'But all this may be explained by such a situation of his', 'affairs as you have supposed.  He had just parted from', 'my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction;', 'and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith,', 'to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet', 'aware that by declining your invitation, by saying', 'that he was going away for some time, he should seem', 'to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family,', 'be might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a case,', 'a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been', 'more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent', 'with his general character;--but I will not raise objections', \"against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation,\", 'as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from', 'what I may think right and consistent.\"', '\"You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does', 'not deserve to be suspected.  Though WE have not known', 'him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world;', 'and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?  Had he been', 'in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,', 'it might have been odd that he should leave us without', 'acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.', 'It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun,', 'for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance;', 'and even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now', 'be very advisable.\"', 'They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret;', 'and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations', 'of her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many,', 'and hope for the justice of all.', 'They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time,', 'when she entered the room and took her place at the table', 'without saying a word.  Her eyes were red and swollen;', 'and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained', 'with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all,', 'could neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her', \"mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion,\", 'her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst', 'into tears and left the room.', 'This violent oppression of spirits continued the', 'whole evening.  She was without any power, because she', 'was without any desire of command over herself.', 'The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby', 'overpowered her in an instant; and though her family', 'were most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was', 'impossible for them, if they spoke at all, to keep clear', 'of every subject which her feelings connected with him.', 'CHAPTER 16', 'Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable', 'had she been able to sleep at all the first night', 'after parting from Willoughby.  She would have been', 'ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning,', 'had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose', 'than when she lay down in it.  But the feelings which', 'made such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger', 'of incurring it.  She was awake the whole night, and she', 'wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with a headache,', 'was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;', 'giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters,', 'and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either.', 'Her sensibility was potent enough!', 'When breakfast was over she walked out by herself,', 'and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the', 'recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present', 'reverse for the chief of the morning.', 'The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.', 'She played over every favourite song that she had been used', 'to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices', 'had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing', 'on every line of music that he had written out for her,', 'till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness', 'could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every', 'day applied.  She spent whole hours at the pianoforte', 'alternately singing and crying; her voice often totally', 'suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as in music,', 'she courted the misery which a contrast between the past', 'and present was certain of giving.  She read nothing', 'but what they had been used to read together.', 'Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported', 'for ever; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy;', 'but these employments, to which she daily recurred,', 'her solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced', 'occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.', 'No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected', 'by Marianne.  Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again', 'became uneasy.  But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations', 'whenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself.', '\"Remember, Elinor,\" said she, \"how very often Sir John', 'fetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them', 'to it.  We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary,', 'and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if', 'their correspondence were to pass through Sir John\\'s hands.\"', 'Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried', 'to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence.', 'But there was one method so direct, so simple, and in', 'her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state', 'of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery,', 'that she could not help suggesting it to her mother.', '\"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\" said she,', '\"whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you,', 'her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question', 'could not give offence.  It would be the natural result', 'of your affection for her.  She used to be all unreserve,', 'and to you more especially.\"', '\"I would not ask such a question for the world.', 'Supposing it possible that they are not engaged,', 'what distress would not such an enquiry inflict!  At any', 'rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never deserve', 'her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession', 'of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.', \"I know Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me,\", 'and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made', 'known,', 'when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.', 'I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one;', 'of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent', 'the denial which her wishes might direct.\"', 'Elinor thought this generosity overstrained,', \"considering her sister's youth, and urged the matter farther,\", 'but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence,', \"were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.\", \"It was several days before Willoughby's name\", 'was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family;', 'Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice;', 'their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--', 'but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a', 'volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,', '\"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear', 'Willoughby went away before we could get through it.', 'We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may', 'be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.\"', '\"Months!\" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.', '\"No--nor many weeks.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said;', 'but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply', 'from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby', 'and knowledge of his intentions.', 'One morning, about a week after his leaving the country,', 'Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their', 'usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself.', 'Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in', 'her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,', 'she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked', 'of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills,', 'and could never be found when the others set off.', 'But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor,', 'who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.  They walked', 'along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,', \"for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor,\", 'satisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.', 'Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the country,', 'though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long', 'stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming', 'to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,', 'they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect', 'which formed the distance of their view from the cottage,', 'from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any', 'of their walks before.', 'Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered', 'an animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them.', 'In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman;', 'and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,', '\"It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!\"--and was', 'hastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out,', '\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is', 'not Willoughby.  The person is not tall enough for him,', 'and has not his air.\"', '\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has.', 'His air, his coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come.\"', 'She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor,', 'to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost', 'certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her', 'pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within', 'thirty yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again;', 'her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round,', 'she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters', 'were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known', \"as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop,\", 'and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome', 'Edward Ferrars.', 'He was the only person in the world who could', 'at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby;', 'the only one who could have gained a smile from her;', 'but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her', \"sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\", 'He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant,', 'walked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely', 'coming to visit them.', 'He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality,', 'but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of', 'regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself.', 'To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister', 'was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she', 'had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.', \"On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency\", 'of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.', 'He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure', 'in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,', 'said little but what was forced from him by questions,', 'and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.', 'Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise.', 'She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended,', 'as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her', 'thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast', 'sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.', 'After a short silence which succeeded the first', 'surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked', 'Edward if he came directly from London.  No, he had', 'been in Devonshire a fortnight.', '\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being', 'so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing', 'her before.', 'He looked rather distressed as he added, that he', 'had been staying with some friends near Plymouth.', '\"Have you been lately in Sussex?\" said Elinor.', '\"I was at Norland about a month ago.\"', '\"And how does dear, dear Norland look?\" cried Marianne.', '\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks', 'much as it always does at this time of the year.', 'The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves.\"', '\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation', 'have I formerly seen them fall!  How have I delighted,', 'as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me', 'by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season, the air', 'altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.', 'They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off,', 'and driven as much as possible from the sight.\"', '\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your', 'passion for dead leaves.\"', '\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often', 'understood.

His coldness and reserve', 'mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry;', 'but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past', 'rather than the present, she avoided every appearance', 'of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she', 'thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.', 'CHAPTER 17', 'Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at', 'seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion,', 'of all things the most natural.  Her joy and expression', 'of regard long outlived her wonder.  He received the kindest', 'welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not', 'stand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him', 'before he entered the house, and they were quite overcome', 'by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man', 'could not very well be in love with either of her daughters,', 'without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the', 'satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.', 'His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all,', 'and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.', 'He was not in spirits, however; he praised their house,', 'admired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still', 'he was not in spirits.  The whole family perceived it,', 'and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality', 'in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all', 'selfish parents.', '\"What are Mrs. Ferrars\\'s views for you at present, Edward?\"', 'said she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round', 'the fire; \"are you still to be a great orator in spite of', 'yourself?\"', '\"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have', 'no more talents than inclination for a public life!\"', '\"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you', 'must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination', 'for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession,', 'and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.\"', '\"I shall not attempt it.

I wish as well as every body else to be', 'perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be', 'in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.\"', '\"Strange that it would!\" cried Marianne.  \"What have', 'wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?\"', '\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth', 'has much to do with it.\"', '\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only', 'give happiness where there is nothing else to give it.', 'Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction,', 'as far as mere self is concerned.\"', '\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come', 'to the same point.  YOUR competence and MY wealth', 'are very much alike, I dare say; and without them,', 'as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every', 'kind of external comfort must be wanting.

This has always been your doctrine,', 'I am sure.\"', '\"No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed', 'at the subjection of the understanding.  All I have', 'ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour.', 'You must not confound my meaning.

Am I reserved, Marianne?\"', '\"Yes, very.\"', '\"I do not understand you,\" replied he, colouring.', '\"Reserved!--how, in what manner?  What am I to tell you?', 'What can you suppose?\"', 'Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying', 'to laugh off the subject, she said to him, \"Do not you', 'know my sister well enough to understand what she means?', 'Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not', 'talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously', 'as herself?\"', 'Edward made no answer.  His gravity and thoughtfulness', 'returned on him in their fullest extent--and he sat', 'for some time silent and dull.', 'CHAPTER 18', 'Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits', 'of her friend.  His visit afforded her but a very', 'partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it', 'appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he was unhappy;', 'she wished it were equally evident that he still', 'distinguished her by the same affection which once', 'she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the', 'continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain;', 'and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted', 'one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding', 'one.', 'He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room', 'the next morning before the others were down; and Marianne,', 'who was always eager to promote their happiness as far', 'as she could, soon left them to themselves.  But before she', 'was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and,', 'turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself come out.', '\"I am going into the village to see my horses,\"', 'said be, \"as you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall', 'be back again presently.\"', '                    ***', 'Edward returned to them with fresh admiration', 'of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village,', 'he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage;', 'and the village itself, in a much higher situation than', 'the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had', 'exceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured', \"Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe\", 'her own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more', 'minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him,', 'when Edward interrupted her by saying, \"You must not', 'enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge', 'in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance', 'and want of taste if we come to particulars.  I shall call', 'hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange', 'and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged;', 'and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be', 'indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.', 'You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can', 'honestly give.  I call it a very fine country--the', 'hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,', 'and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich', 'meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here', 'and there.  It exactly answers my idea of a fine country,', 'because it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say it', 'is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can', 'easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories,', 'grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.', 'I know nothing of the picturesque.\"', '\"I am afraid it is but too true,\" said Marianne;', '\"but why should you boast of it?\"', '\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind', 'of affectation, Edward here falls into another.  Because he', 'believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties', 'of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with', 'such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less', 'discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses.', 'He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"', '\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration', 'of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon.', 'Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with', 'the taste and elegance of him who first defined what', 'picturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind,', 'and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself,', 'because I could find no language to describe them', 'in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning.\"', '\"I am convinced,\" said Edward, \"that you really feel', 'all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess', 'to feel.  But, in return, your sister must allow me', 'to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,', 'but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked,', 'twisted, blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they', 'are tall, straight, and flourishing.  I do not like ruined,', 'tattered cottages.  I am not fond of nettles or thistles,', 'or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a snug', 'farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy,', 'happy villages please me better than the finest banditti', 'in the world.\"', 'Marianne looked with amazement at Edward,', 'with compassion at her sister.  Elinor only laughed.', 'The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne', 'remained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly', 'engaged her attention.  She was sitting by Edward, and', 'in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed', 'so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait', 'of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.', '\"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,\" she cried.', '\"Is that Fanny\\'s hair? I remember her promising to give', 'you some.  But I should have thought her hair had been darker.\"', 'Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--', 'but when she saw how much she had pained Edward, her own', 'vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed', 'by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary', 'glance at Elinor, replied, \"Yes; it is my sister\\'s hair.', 'The setting always casts a different shade on it,', 'you know.\"', 'Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.', 'That the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as', 'well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their', 'conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free', 'gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been', 'procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.', 'She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,', 'and affecting to take no notice of what passed,', 'by instantly talking of something else, she internally', 'resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing', 'the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt,', 'that it was exactly the shade of her own.', \"Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it\", 'ended in an absence of mind still more settled.', 'He was particularly grave the whole morning.', 'Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said;', 'but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,', 'had she known how little offence it had given her sister.', 'Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir', 'John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival', 'of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey', 'of the guest.  With the assistance of his mother-in-law,', 'Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of', 'Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine', 'of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but', 'the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have', 'prevented from being immediately sprung.  But, as it was,', 'she only learned, from some very significant looks, how far', \"their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions, extended.\", 'Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either', 'inviting them to dine at the park the next day, or to drink', 'tea with them that evening.  On the present occasion,', 'for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards', 'whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,', 'he wished to engage them for both.', '\"You MUST drink tea with us to night,\" said he,', '\"for we shall be quite alone--and tomorrow you must', 'absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party.\"', 'Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  \"And who knows', 'but you may raise a dance,\" said she.  \"And that will', 'tempt YOU, Miss Marianne.\"', '\"A dance!\" cried Marianne.  \"Impossible! Who is to dance?\"', '\"Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers', 'to be sure.--What! you thought nobody could dance', 'because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!\"', '\"I wish with all my soul,\" cried Sir John,', '\"that Willoughby were among us again.\"', \"This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions\", 'to Edward.  \"And who is Willoughby?\" said he, in a low voice,', 'to Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting.', \"She gave him a brief reply.  Marianne's countenance\", 'was more communicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend,', \"not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's\", 'expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their', 'visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said,', 'in a whisper, \"I have been guessing.  Shall I tell you', 'my guess?\"', '\"What do you mean?\"', '\"Shall I tell you.\"', '\"Certainly.\"', '\"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.\"', 'Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could', 'not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner,', \"and after a moment's silence, said,\", '\"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come', 'I hope...I am sure you will like him.\"', '\"I do not doubt it,\" replied he, rather astonished', 'at her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it', 'to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general,', 'founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby', 'and herself, he would not have ventured to mention it.', 'CHAPTER 19', 'Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly', 'pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he', 'were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved', 'to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at', 'the height.  His spirits, during the last two or three days,', 'though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew', 'more and more partial to the house and environs--never', 'spoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time', 'to be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he', 'should go when he left them--but still, go he must.', 'Never had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly', 'believe it to be gone.  He said so repeatedly; other things', 'he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave', 'the lie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland;', 'he detested being in town; but either to Norland or London,', 'he must go.  He valued their kindness beyond any thing,', 'and his greatest happiness was in being with them.', 'Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite', 'of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint', 'on his time.', 'Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this', \"way of acting to his mother's account; and it was\", 'happy for her that he had a mother whose character', 'was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general', 'excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.', 'Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes', 'displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself,', 'she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions', 'with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,', 'which had been rather more painfully extorted from her,', \"for Willoughby's service, by her mother.  His want of spirits,\", 'of openness, and of consistency, were most usually', 'attributed to his want of independence, and his better', \"knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs.\", 'The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose', 'in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination,', 'the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.', 'The old well-established grievance of duty against will,', 'parent against child, was the cause of all.  She would have', 'been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease,', 'this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would', 'be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.', 'But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort', \"to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection,\", 'to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word', 'which fell from him while at Barton, and above all', 'to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore', 'round his finger.', '\"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were', 'at breakfast the last morning, \"you would be a happier man', 'if you had any profession to engage your time and give', 'an interest to your plans and actions.  Some inconvenience', 'to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you', 'would not be able to give them so much of your time.', 'But (with a smile) you would be materially benefited', 'in one particular at least--you would know where to go', 'when you left them.\"', '\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long', 'thought on this point, as you think now.  It has been,', 'and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune', 'to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me,', 'no profession to give me employment, or afford me any', 'thing like independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety,', 'and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am,', 'an idle, helpless being.  We never could agree in our', 'choice of a profession.  I always preferred the church,', 'as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.', 'They recommended the army.  That was a great deal', 'too smart for me.  The law was allowed to be genteel', 'enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple,', 'made a very good appearance in the first circles,', 'and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had', 'no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse', 'study of it, which my family approved.  As for the navy,', 'it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the', 'subject was first started to enter it--and, at length,', 'as there was no necessity for my having any profession', 'at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without', 'a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced', 'on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable,', 'and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly', 'bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his', 'friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford', 'and have been properly idle ever since.\"', '\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\"', 'said Mrs. Dashwood, \"since leisure has not promoted', 'your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up', 'to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades', 'as Columella\\'s.\"', '\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent,', '\"to be as unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling,', 'in action, in condition, in every thing.\"', '\"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate', 'want of spirits, Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour,', 'and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.', 'But remember that the pain of parting from friends', 'will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their', 'education or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want', 'nothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name,', 'call it hope.  Your mother will secure to you, in time,', 'that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty,', 'and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to', 'prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.', 'How much may not a few months do?\"', '\"I think,\" replied Edward, \"that I may defy many', 'months to produce any good to me.\"', 'This desponding turn of mind, though it could not', 'be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain', 'to them all in the parting, which shortly took place,', \"and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's\", 'feelings especially, which required some trouble and time', 'to subdue.  But as it was her determination to subdue it,', 'and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than', 'what all her family suffered on his going away, she did', 'not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne,', 'on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow,', 'by seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means', 'were as different as their objects, and equally suited', 'to the advancement of each.', 'Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he', 'was out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day,', 'neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name,', 'appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the', 'general concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct,', 'she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented', 'from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters', 'were spared much solicitude on her account.', 'Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse', 'of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne,', 'than her own had seemed faulty to her.  The business', 'of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong', 'affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could', \"have no merit.  That her sister's affections WERE calm,\", 'she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it;', 'and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof,', 'by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite', 'of this mortifying conviction.', 'Without shutting herself up from her family,', 'or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them,', 'or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation,', 'Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough', \"to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every\", 'possible variety which the different state of her spirits', 'at different times could produce,--with tenderness,', 'pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.  There were moments', 'in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother', 'and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,', 'conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect', 'of solitude was produced.  Her mind was inevitably', 'at liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere;', 'and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting,', 'must be before her, must force her attention, and engross', 'her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.', 'From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her', 'drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after', \"Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of company.\", 'She happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the', 'little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front', 'of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw', 'a large party walking up to the door.  Amongst them', 'were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,', 'but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were', 'quite unknown to her.  She was sitting near the window,', 'and as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest', 'of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,', 'and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the', 'casement to speak to him, though the space was so short', 'between the door and the window, as to make it hardly', 'possible to speak at one without being heard at the other.', '\"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers.', 'How do you like them?\"', '\"Hush! they will hear you.\"', '\"Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.', 'Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her', 'if you look this way.\"', 'As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple', 'of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged', 'to be excused.', '\"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we', 'are come? I see her instrument is open.\"', '\"She is walking, I believe.\"', 'They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not', 'patience enough to wait till the door was opened before', 'she told HER story.  She came hallooing to the window,', '\"How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs. Dashwood do?', 'And where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you', 'will be glad of a little company to sit with you.', 'I have brought my other son and daughter to see you.', 'Only think of their coming so suddenly!  I thought I heard', 'a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,', 'but it never entered my head that it could be them.', 'I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel', 'Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think', 'I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come', 'back again\"--', 'Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle', 'of her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady', 'Middleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood', 'and Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they', 'all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings', 'continued her story as she walked through the passage', 'into the parlour, attended by Sir John.', 'Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady', 'Middleton, and totally unlike her in every respect.', 'She was short and plump, had a very pretty face,', 'and the finest expression of good humour in it that could', 'possibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant', \"as her sister's, but they were much more prepossessing.\", 'She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit,', 'except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away.', 'Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six', 'and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than', 'his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased.', 'He entered the room with a look of self-consequence,', 'slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word,', 'and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments,', 'took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it', 'as long as he staid.', 'Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed', 'by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy,', 'was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour', 'and every thing in it burst forth.', '\"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never', 'saw anything so charming!  Only think, Mamma, how it', 'is improved since I was here last! I always thought it', \"such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood)\", 'but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister,', 'how delightful every thing is! How I should like such', 'a house for myself!  Should not you, Mr. Palmer?\"', 'Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise', 'his eyes from the newspaper.', '\"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing;', '\"he never does sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!\"', 'This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had', 'never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one,', 'and could not help looking with surprise at them both.', 'Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud', 'as she could, and continued her account of their surprise,', 'the evening before, on seeing their friends, without', 'ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer laughed', 'heartily at the recollection of their astonishment,', 'and every body agreed, two or three times over, that it', 'had been quite an agreeable surprise.', '\"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\"', 'added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor,', 'and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard', 'by no one else, though they were seated on different sides', 'of the room; \"but, however, I can\\'t help wishing they had', 'not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey', 'of it, for they came all round by London upon account', 'of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and', 'pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation.', 'I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning,', 'but she would come with us; she longed so much to see', 'you all!\"', 'Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her', 'any harm.', '\"She expects to be confined in February,\"', 'continued Mrs. Jennings.', 'Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation,', 'and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there', 'was any news in the paper.', '\"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.', '\"Here comes Marianne,\" cried Sir John.  \"Now, Palmer,', 'you shall see a monstrous pretty girl.\"', 'He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door,', 'and ushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her,', 'as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham;', 'and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question,', 'as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer looked up', 'on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes,', \"and then returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer's eye\", 'was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room.', 'She got up to examine them.', '\"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!', 'Do but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming;', 'I could look at them for ever.\" And then sitting down again,', 'she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.', 'When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer', 'rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself', 'and looked at them all around.', '\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.', 'He made her no answer; and only observed, after again', 'examining the room, that it was very low pitched,', 'and that the ceiling was crooked.  He then made his bow,', 'and departed with the rest.', 'Sir John had been very urgent with them all to', 'spend the next day at the park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did', 'not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined', 'at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;', 'her daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no', 'curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner,', 'and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way.', 'They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves;', 'the weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good.', 'But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should', 'be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too,', 'though she did not press their mother, pressed them.', 'Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all', 'seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young', 'ladies were obliged to yield.', '\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they', 'were gone.  \"The rent of this cottage is said to be low;', 'but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine', 'at the park whenever any one is staying either with them,', 'or with us.\"', '\"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\"', 'said Elinor, \"by these frequent invitations, than by', 'those which we received from them a few weeks ago.', 'The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown', 'tedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere.\"', 'CHAPTER 20', 'As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park', 'the next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at', 'the other, looking as good humoured and merry as before.', 'She took them all most affectionately by the hand,', 'and expressed great delight in seeing them again.', '\"I am so glad to see you!\" said she, seating herself', 'between Elinor and Marianne, \"for it is so bad a day I was', 'afraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing,', 'as we go away again tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons', 'come to us next week you know.  It was quite a sudden thing', 'our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage', 'was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I', 'would go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never', 'tells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer;', 'however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope.\"', 'They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.', '\"Not go to town!\" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh,', '\"I shall be quite disappointed if you do not.

I am sure', 'I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till', 'I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go', 'into public.\"', 'They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all', 'her entreaties.', '\"Oh, my love,\" cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband,', 'who just then entered the room--\"you must help me to', 'persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter.\"', 'Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing', 'to the ladies, began complaining of the weather.', '\"How horrid all this is!\" said he.  \"Such weather', 'makes every thing and every body disgusting.  Dullness', 'is as much produced within doors as without, by rain.', \"It makes one detest all one's acquaintance.  What the\", 'devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room', 'in his house?  How few people know what comfort is!  Sir', 'John is as stupid as the weather.\"', 'The rest of the company soon dropt in.', '\"I am afraid, Miss Marianne,\" said Sir John, \"you have', 'not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today.\"', 'Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.', '\"Oh, don\\'t be so sly before us,\" said Mrs. Palmer;', '\"for we know all about it, I assure you; and I admire your', 'taste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome.', 'We do not live a great way from him in the country, you know.', 'Not above ten miles, I dare say.\"', '\"Much nearer thirty,\" said her husband.', '\"Ah, well! there is not much difference.', 'I never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet', 'pretty place.\"', '\"As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,\"', 'said Mr. Palmer.', 'Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her', 'countenance betrayed her interest in what was said.', '\"Is it very ugly?\" continued Mrs. Palmer--\"then it', 'must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose.\"', 'When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John', 'observed with regret that they were only eight all together.', '\"My dear,\" said he to his lady, \"it is very provoking', 'that we should be so few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts', 'to come to us today?\"', '\"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me', 'about it before, that it could not be done?  They dined', 'with us last.\"', '\"You and I, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Jennings,', '\"should not stand upon such ceremony.\"', '\"Then you would be very ill-bred,\" cried Mr. Palmer.', '\"My love you contradict every body,\" said his wife', 'with her usual laugh.  \"Do you know that you are quite rude?\"', '\"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling', 'your mother ill-bred.\"', '\"Ay, you may abuse me as you please,\" said the good-natured', 'old lady, \"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot', 'give her back again.  So there I have the whip hand of you.\"', 'Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her', 'husband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said,', 'she did not care how cross he was to her, as they must', 'live together.  It was impossible for any one to be more', 'thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy', 'than Mrs. Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence,', 'and discontent of her husband gave her no pain;', 'and when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted.', '\"Mr. Palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper,', 'to Elinor.  \"He is always out of humour.\"', 'Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation,', 'to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly', 'ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.', 'His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding,', 'like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable', 'bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly', 'woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too', 'common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.--', 'It was rather a wish of distinction, she believed,', 'which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body,', 'and his general abuse of every thing before him.', 'It was the desire of appearing superior to other people.', 'The motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means,', 'however they might succeed by establishing his superiority', 'in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him', 'except his wife.', '\"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards,', '\"I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.', 'Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this', 'Christmas?  Now, pray do,--and come while the Westons are', 'with us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!

I am sure you', 'will like it of all things.  The Westons will be with us,', 'and it will be quite delightful.  You cannot think', 'what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now,', 'for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing', 'against the election; and so many people came to dine', 'with us that I never saw before, it is quite charming!  But,', 'poor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced', 'to make every body like him.\"', 'Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she', 'assented to the hardship of such an obligation.', '\"How charming it will be,\" said Charlotte, \"when he', \"is in Parliament!--won't it? How I shall laugh!  It will\", 'be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him', 'with an M.P.--But do you know, he says, he will never frank', 'for me?  He declares he won\\'t.  Don\\'t you, Mr. Palmer?\"', 'Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.', '\"He cannot bear writing, you know,\" she continued--', '\"he says it is quite shocking.\"', '\"No,\" said he, \"I never said any thing so irrational.', 'Don\\'t palm all your abuses of languages upon me.\"', '\"There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always', \"the way with him!  Sometimes he won't speak to me for half\", 'a day together, and then he comes out with something', 'so droll--all about any thing in the world.\"', 'She surprised Elinor very much as they returned', 'into the drawing-room, by asking her whether she did', 'not like Mr. Palmer excessively.', '\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"he seems very agreeable.\"', '\"Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would,', 'he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased', \"with you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can't\", \"think how disappointed he will be if you don't come\", \"to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object\", 'to it.\"', 'Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation;', 'and by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties.', 'She thought it probable that as they lived in the', 'same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some', \"more particular account of Willoughby's general\", \"character, than could be gathered from the Middletons'\", 'partial acquaintance with him; and she was eager to gain', 'from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as might', 'remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began', 'by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,', 'and whether they were intimately acquainted with him.', '\"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,\"', 'replied Mrs. Palmer;--\"Not that I ever spoke', 'to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.', 'Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton', 'while he was at Allenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--', 'but I was with my uncle at Weymouth.  However, I dare say', 'we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire,', 'if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never', 'have been in the country together.  He is very little', 'at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there,', 'I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is', 'in the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a', 'way off.  I know why you inquire about him, very well;', 'your sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it,', 'for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know.\"', '\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"you know much', 'more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason', 'to expect such a match.\"', '\"Don\\'t pretend to deny it, because you know it is', 'what every body talks of.  I assure you I heard of it', 'in my way through town.\"', '\"My dear Mrs. Palmer!\"', '\"Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon', 'Monday morning in Bond-street, just before we left town,', 'and he told me of it directly.\"', '\"You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell', 'you of it!  Surely you must be mistaken.  To give such', 'intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it,', 'even if it were true, is not what I should expect Colonel', 'Brandon to do.\"', '\"But I do assure you it was so, for all that,', 'and I will tell you how it happened.  When we met him,', 'he turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking', 'of my brother and sister, and one thing and another,', \"and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family\", 'come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word', 'they are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be', 'married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna.  Is it true,', 'pray? for of course you must know, as you have been in', 'Devonshire so lately.\\'\"', '\"And what did the Colonel say?\"', '\"Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he', 'knew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down', 'as certain.  It will be quite delightful, I declare!', 'When is it to take place?\"', '\"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\"', '\"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises,', 'he did nothing but say fine things of you.\"', '\"I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems', 'an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing.\"', '\"So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it', 'is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull.', 'Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.--', 'I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he', 'hardly ever falls in love with any body.\"', '\"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part', 'of Somersetshire?\" said Elinor.', '\"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe', 'many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna', 'is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable', 'I assure you.  Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby', 'wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.', 'She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour;', 'not but that he is much more lucky in getting her,', 'because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing', \"can be good enough for her.  However, I don't think\", 'her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you;', 'for I think you both excessively pretty, and so does', 'Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him', 'to own it last night.\"', \"Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby\", 'was not very material; but any testimony in his favour,', 'however small, was pleasing to her.', '\"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,\"', 'continued Charlotte.--\"And now I hope we shall always be', \"great friends.  You can't think how much I longed to see you!\", 'It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage!', 'Nothing can be like it, to be sure!  And I am so glad', 'your sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will', 'be a great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place,', 'by all accounts.\"', '\"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon,', 'have not you?\"', '\"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.--', 'He was a particular friend of Sir John\\'s. I believe,\"', 'she added in a low voice, \"he would have been very', 'glad to have had me, if he could.  Sir John and Lady', 'Middleton wished it very much.

However, I am much happier as I am.', 'Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like.\"', 'CHAPTER 21', 'The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day,', 'and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain', 'each other.  But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly', 'got their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done', \"wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause,\", \"at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities,\", 'and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between', \"husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's\", 'active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some', 'other new acquaintance to see and observe.', \"In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with\", 'two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction', 'of discovering to be her relations, and this was enough', 'for Sir John to invite them directly to the park,', 'as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.', 'Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before', 'such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into', 'no little alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing', 'that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls', 'whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose elegance,--', 'whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof;', 'for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject', 'went for nothing at all.  Their being her relations too', \"made it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts\", 'at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded,', 'when she advised her daughter not to care about their being', 'so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put', 'up with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to', 'prevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the', 'idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman,', 'contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle', 'reprimand on the subject five or six times every day.', 'The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by', 'no means ungenteel or unfashionable.  Their dress was', 'very smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted', 'with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,', 'and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children', \"that Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their\", 'favour before they had been an hour at the Park.', 'She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed,', 'which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.', \"Sir John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this\", 'animated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage', \"to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival,\", 'and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls', 'in the world.  From such commendation as this, however,', 'there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew', 'that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met', 'with in every part of England, under every possible', 'variation of form, face, temper and understanding.', 'Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly', 'and look at his guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It', 'was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself.', '\"Do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--I', \"declare you shall come--You can't think how you will\", 'like them.  Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured', 'and agreeable!  The children are all hanging about her already,', 'as if she was an old acquaintance.  And they both long', 'to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter', 'that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world;', 'and I have told them it is all very true, and a great', 'deal more.  You will be delighted with them I am sure.', 'They have brought the whole coach full of playthings', 'for the children.

He could only obtain', 'a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two,', 'and then left them in amazement at their indifference,', 'to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the', 'Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss', 'Steeles to them.', 'When their promised visit to the Park and consequent', 'introduction to these young ladies took place, they found', 'in the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty,', 'with a very plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire;', 'but in the other, who was not more than two or three', 'and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her', 'features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye,', 'and a smartness of air, which though it did not give', 'actual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.--', 'Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon', 'allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she', 'saw with what constant and judicious attention they', 'were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton.', 'With her children they were in continual raptures,', 'extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring', 'their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from', 'the importunate demands which this politeness made on it,', 'was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing,', 'if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns', 'of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance', 'the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.', 'Fortunately for those who pay their court through', 'such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise', 'for her children, the most rapacious of human beings,', 'is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant;', 'but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive', 'affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards', 'her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton', 'without the smallest surprise or distrust.  She saw with', 'maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments', 'and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.', 'She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about', 'their ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives', 'and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being', 'a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other surprise', 'than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,', 'without claiming a share in what was passing.', '\"John is in such spirits today!\" said she, on his', \"taking Miss Steeles's pocket handkerchief, and throwing\", 'it out of window--\"He is full of monkey tricks.\"', \"And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently\", \"pinching one of the same lady's fingers, she fondly observed,\", '\"How playful William is!\"', '\"And here is my sweet little Annamaria,\" she added,', 'tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old,', 'who had not made a noise for the last two minutes;', '\"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there', 'such a quiet little thing!\"', 'But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces,', \"a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly scratching\", \"the child's neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness\", 'such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any', \"creature professedly noisy.

Not a soul of all my relations', 'know of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned', 'it to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence', 'in the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my', 'behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars', 'must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.', 'And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased,', 'when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has', 'the highest opinion in the world of all your family,', 'and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite', 'as his own sisters.\"--She paused.', 'Elinor for a few moments remained silent.', 'Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too', 'great for words; but at length forcing herself to speak,', 'and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,', 'which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--', '\"May I ask if your engagement is of long standing?\"', '\"We have been engaged these four years.\"', '\"Four years!\"', '\"Yes.\"', 'Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable', 'to believe it.', '\"I did not know,\" said she, \"that you were even', 'acquainted till the other day.\"', '\"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.', 'He was under my uncle\\'s care, you know, a considerable while.\"', '\"Your uncle!\"', '\"Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk', 'of Mr. Pratt?\"', '\"I think I have,\" replied Elinor, with an exertion', 'of spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion.', '\"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple,', 'near Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun,', 'for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle,', 'and it was there our engagement was formed, though not till', 'a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost', 'always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter', 'into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and', 'approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved', 'him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.--', 'Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood,', 'you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is', 'very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"', '\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what', \"she said; but after a moment's reflection, she added,\", \"with revived security of Edward's honour and love,\", 'and her companion\\'s falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward', 'Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at', 'what you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon;', 'but surely there must be some mistake of person or name.', 'We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\"', '\"We can mean no other,\" cried Lucy, smiling.  \"Mr. Edward', 'Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street,', 'and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood,', 'is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely', 'to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness', 'depends.\"', '\"It is strange,\" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity,', '\"that I should never have heard him even mention your name.\"', '\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange.', 'Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.--', 'You knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore,', 'there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name', 'to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his', \"sister's suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough\", 'for his not mentioning it.\"', \"She was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but her\", 'self-command did not sink with it.', '\"Four years you have been engaged,\" said she', 'with a firm voice.', '\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have', 'to wait.  Poor Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart.\"', 'Then taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added,', '\"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look', 'at this face.  It does not do him justice, to be sure,', 'but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person', 'it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years.\"', 'She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor', 'saw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a', 'too hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood', 'might suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of', \"its being Edward's face.

But I am', 'determined to set for it the very first opportunity.\"', '\"You are quite in the right,\" replied Elinor calmly.', 'They then proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.', '\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world', 'of your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must', 'know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach', 'his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say.', 'I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding', 'proud woman.\"', '\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor;', '\"but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I', 'may be depended on.  Your secret is safe with me;', 'but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary', 'a communication.  You must at least have felt that my', 'being acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"', 'As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy,', 'hoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the', 'falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;', \"but Lucy's countenance suffered no change.\", '\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great', 'liberty with you,\" said she, \"in telling you all this.', 'I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least,', 'but I have known you and all your family by description', 'a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if', 'you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case,', 'I really thought some explanation was due to you after my', \"making such particular inquiries about Edward's mother;\", 'and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose', 'advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that knows of it,', 'and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great', 'deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her', 'betraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue,', 'as you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest', \"fright in the world t'other day, when Edward's name was\", 'mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all.', \"You can't think how much I go through in my mind from\", 'it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what', \"I have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.\", 'Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing', 'him so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year.', 'I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke.\"', 'Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did', 'not feel very compassionate.', '\"Sometimes.\" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes,', '\"I think whether it would not be better for us both', 'to break off the matter entirely.\"  As she said this,', 'she looked directly at her companion.  \"But then', 'at other times I have not resolution enough for it.--', 'I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable,', 'as I know the very mention of such a thing would do.', \"And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I don't\", 'think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise', 'me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you', 'do yourself?\"', '\"Pardon me,\" replied Elinor, startled by the question;', '\"but I can give you no advice under such circumstances.', 'Your own judgment must direct you.\"', '\"To be sure,\" continued Lucy, after a few minutes', 'silence on both sides, \"his mother must provide for him', 'sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it!', 'Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at', 'Barton?  He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple,', 'to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill.\"', '\"Did he come from your uncle\\'s, then, when he visited us?\"', '\"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.', 'Did you think he came directly from town?\"', '\"No,\" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of', \"every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity;\", '\"I remember he told us, that he had been staying', 'a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\"', 'She remembered too, her own surprise at the time,', 'at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends,', 'at his total silence with respect even to their names.', '\"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\"', 'repeated Lucy.', '\"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"', '\"I begged him to exert himself for fear you', 'should suspect what was the matter; but it made him', 'so melancholy, not being able to stay more than a', 'fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.--', 'Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now;', 'for he writes in wretched spirits.  I heard from him just', 'before I left Exeter;\" taking a letter from her pocket', 'and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.', '\"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is;', 'but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired,', 'I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full', 'as possible.\"', 'Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt', 'no longer.  This picture, she had allowed herself to believe,', 'might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have', \"been Edward's gift; but a correspondence between them\", 'by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement,', 'could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she', 'was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she could', 'hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary;', 'and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression', 'of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for', 'the time complete.', '\"Writing to each other,\" said Lucy, returning the', 'letter into her pocket, \"is the only comfort we have', 'in such long separations.  Yes, I have one other comfort', 'in his picture, but poor Edward has not even THAT.', 'If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.', 'I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at', 'Longstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said,', 'but not equal to a picture.  Perhaps you might notice', 'the ring when you saw him?\"', '\"I did,\" said Elinor, with a composure of voice,', 'under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond', 'any thing she had ever felt before.  She was mortified,', 'shocked, confounded.', 'Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage,', 'and the conversation could be continued no farther.', 'After sitting with them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles', 'returned to the Park, and Elinor was then at liberty', 'to think and be wretched.', '[At this point in the first and second editions, Volume 1 ends.]', 'CHAPTER 23', \"However small Elinor's general dependence on\", \"Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her\", 'on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case,', 'where no temptation could be answerable to the folly', 'of inventing a falsehood of such a description.  What Lucy', 'had asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not,', 'dared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every', 'side by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted', 'by nothing but her own wishes.  Their opportunity of', 'acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation', \"for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's\", 'visit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind,', 'his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain', 'behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the', 'Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections,', 'which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,', 'the ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence,', 'as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,', 'and established as a fact, which no partiality could', 'set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment', 'of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,', 'for a short time made her feel only for herself;', 'but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.', 'Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had he feigned', 'a regard for her which he did not feel?  Was his engagement', 'to Lucy an engagement of the heart?  No; whatever it might', 'once have been, she could not believe it such at present.', 'His affection was all her own.  She could not be deceived', 'in that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been', 'conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not', 'an illusion of her own vanity.  He certainly loved her.', 'What a softener of the heart was this persuasion!  How much', 'could it not tempt her to forgive!  He had been blamable,', 'highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first', 'felt her influence over him to be more than it ought', 'to be.  In that, he could not be defended; but if he', 'had injured her, how much more had he injured himself;', 'if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless.', 'His imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it', 'seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever', 'being otherwise.  She might in time regain tranquillity;', 'but HE, what had he to look forward to?  Could he', 'ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he,', 'were his affection for herself out of the question,', 'with his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind,', 'be satisfied with a wife like her--illiterate, artful,', 'and selfish?', 'The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally', 'blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature;', 'but the four succeeding years--years, which if rationally', 'spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must', 'have opened his eyes to her defects of education,', 'while the same period of time, spent on her side', 'in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits,', 'had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might', 'once have given an interesting character to her beauty.', 'If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself,', 'his difficulties from his mother had seemed great,', 'how much greater were they now likely to be, when', 'the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior', 'in connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.', 'These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated', 'from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience;', 'but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the', 'expectation of family opposition and unkindness, could', 'be felt as a relief!', 'As these considerations occurred to her in painful', 'succession, she wept for him, more than for herself.', 'Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to', 'merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief', 'that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem,', 'she thought she could even now, under the first smart', 'of the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every', 'suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters.', 'And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,', 'that when she joined them at dinner only two hours', 'after she had first suffered the extinction of all her', 'dearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the', 'appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning', 'in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever', 'from the object of her love, and that Marianne was', 'internally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose', 'whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she', 'expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.', 'The necessity of concealing from her mother and', 'Marianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to herself,', 'though it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no', \"aggravation of Elinor's distress.  On the contrary\", 'it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication', 'of what would give such affliction to them, and to be', 'saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward,', 'which would probably flow from the excess of their partial', 'affection for herself, and which was more than she felt', 'equal to support.', 'From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew', 'she could receive no assistance, their tenderness and', 'sorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command', 'would neither receive encouragement from their example', 'nor from their praise.  She was stronger alone,', 'and her own good sense so well supported her, that her', 'firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness', 'as invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh,', 'it was possible for them to be.', 'Much as she had suffered from her first conversation', 'with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish', 'of renewing it; and this for more reasons than one.', 'She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement', 'repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand', 'what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any', 'sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him,', 'and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her', 'readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness', 'in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested', 'in it than as a friend, which she very much feared', 'her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse,', 'must have left at least doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed', 'to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain', 'that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise,', \"not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing\", 'to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance,', 'with a secret so confessedly and evidently important.', \"And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had\", 'some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor remained so well', 'assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward,', 'it required no other consideration of probabilities', 'to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous;', 'and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.', 'What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could', \"there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's\", 'superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him', 'in future?  She had little difficulty in understanding thus', \"much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly\", 'resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and', 'honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward', 'and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny', 'herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy', 'that her heart was unwounded.  And as she could now have', 'nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already', 'been told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going', 'through a repetition of particulars with composure.', 'But it was not immediately that an opportunity', 'of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well', 'disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred;', 'for the weather was not often fine enough to allow', 'of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily', 'separate themselves from the others; and though they', 'met at least every other evening either at the park', 'or cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could', 'not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.', 'Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady', \"Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure\", 'was ever given for a general chat, and none at all for', 'particular discourse.  They met for the sake of eating,', 'drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,', 'or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.', 'One or two meetings of this kind had taken place,', 'without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy', 'in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning,', 'to beg, in the name of charity, that they would all', 'dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged', 'to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be', 'quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.', 'Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she', 'had in view, in such a party as this was likely to be,', 'more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil', 'and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when', 'her husband united them together in one noisy purpose,', 'immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her', \"mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne,\", 'though always unwilling to join any of their parties,', 'was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her', 'seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.', 'The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily', 'preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her.', 'The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor', 'had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought', 'or expression, and nothing could be less interesting', 'than the whole of their discourse both in the dining', 'parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children', 'accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was', \"too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy's\", 'attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the', 'removal of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed,', 'and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever', 'entertained a hope of finding time for conversation', 'at the park.  They all rose up in preparation for a round game.', '\"I am glad,\" said Lady Middleton to Lucy,', '\"you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria\\'s', 'basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your', 'eyes to work filigree by candlelight.

That would', 'be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time', 'and chance for the rest.\"', '\"I should always be happy,\" replied Elinor, \"to show', 'any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars;', 'but do you not perceive that my interest on such an', 'occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He is brother', 'to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough', 'to her husband.\"', '\"But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve', 'of Edward\\'s going into orders.\"', '\"Then I rather suspect that my interest would', 'do very little.\"', 'They were again silent for many minutes.  At length', 'Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,', '\"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end', 'to the business at once by dissolving the engagement.', 'We seem so beset with difficulties on every side,', 'that though it would make us miserable for a time,', 'we should be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will', 'not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?\"', '\"No,\" answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed', 'very agitated feelings, \"on such a subject I certainly', 'will not.  You know very well that my opinion would have', 'no weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes.\"', '\"Indeed you wrong me,\" replied Lucy, with great', 'solemnity; \"I know nobody of whose judgment I think', 'so highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe,', \"that if you was to say to me, 'I advise you by all means\", 'to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars,', \"it will be more for the happiness of both of you,'\", 'I should resolve upon doing it immediately.\"', \"Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's\", 'future wife, and replied, \"This compliment would effectually', 'frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject', 'had I formed one.  It raises my influence much too high;', 'the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached', 'is too much for an indifferent person.\"', '\"\\'Tis because you are an indifferent person,\" said Lucy,', 'with some pique, and laying a particular stress on those words,', '\"that your judgment might justly have such weight with me.', 'If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect', 'by your own feelings, your opinion would not be worth having.\"', 'Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this,', 'lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase', 'of ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined', 'never to mention the subject again.  Another pause', \"therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech,\", 'and Lucy was still the first to end it.', '\"Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?\"', 'said she with all her accustomary complacency.', '\"Certainly not.\"', '\"I am sorry for that,\" returned the other,', 'while her eyes brightened at the information,', '\"it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there!', 'But I dare say you will go for all that.  To be sure,', 'your brother and sister will ask you to come to them.\"', '\"It will not be in my power to accept their invitation', 'if they do.\"', '\"How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon', 'meeting you there.  Anne and me are to go the latter end', 'of January to some relations who have been wanting us to', 'visit them these several years!  But I only go for the sake', 'of seeing Edward.  He will be there in February, otherwise', 'London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.\"', 'Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the', 'conclusion of the first rubber, and the confidential', 'discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end,', 'to which both of them submitted without any reluctance,', 'for nothing had been said on either side to make them', 'dislike each other less than they had done before;', 'and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy', 'persuasion that Edward was not only without affection', 'for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had', 'not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage,', 'which sincere affection on HER side would have given,', 'for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man', 'to an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware', 'that he was weary.', 'From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor,', 'and when entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity', 'of introducing it, and was particularly careful to inform', 'her confidante, of her happiness whenever she received a letter', 'from Edward, it was treated by the former with calmness', 'and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow;', 'for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which', 'Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.', 'The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was', 'lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied.', 'Their favour increased; they could not be spared;', 'Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite', 'of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter,', 'in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill', 'them immediately, which was in full force at the end', 'of every week, they were prevailed on to stay nearly two', 'months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration', 'of that festival which requires a more than ordinary', 'share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim', 'its importance.', 'CHAPTER 25', 'Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large', 'portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends,', 'she was not without a settled habitation of her own.', 'Since the death of her husband, who had traded with success', 'in a less elegant part of the town, she had resided every', 'winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square.', 'Towards this home, she began on the approach of January', 'to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly,', 'and very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses', 'Dashwood to accompany her.  Elinor, without observing', 'the varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look', 'which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave', 'a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she', 'believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations.', 'The reason alleged was their determined resolution', 'of not leaving their mother at that time of the year.', 'Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise,', 'and repeated her invitation immediately.', '\"Oh, Lord!

We three shall be able to go', 'very well in my chaise; and when we are in town,', 'if you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good,', 'you may always go with one of my daughters.  I am sure', 'your mother will not object to it; for I have had such', 'good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she', 'will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you;', \"and if I don't get one of you at least well married\", 'before I have done with you, it shall not be my fault.', 'I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men,', 'you may depend upon it.\"', '\"I have a notion,\" said Sir John, \"that Miss Marianne', 'would not object to such a scheme, if her elder sister', 'would come into it.  It is very hard indeed that she', 'should not have a little pleasure, because Miss Dashwood', 'does not wish it.  So I would advise you two, to set off', 'for town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying', 'a word to Miss Dashwood about it.\"', '\"Nay,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure I shall be', \"monstrous glad of Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss\", 'Dashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say I,', 'and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to', 'be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk', 'to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.', 'But one or the other, if not both of them, I must have.', 'Lord bless me! how do you think I can live poking by myself,', 'I who have been always used till this winter to have', 'Charlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike', 'hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change', 'her mind by and bye, why so much the better.\"', '\"I thank you, ma\\'am, sincerely thank you,\" said Marianne,', 'with warmth: \"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever,', 'and it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest', 'happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it.', 'But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I feel the', 'justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be', 'made less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no,', 'nothing should tempt me to leave her.  It should not,', 'must not be a struggle.\"', 'Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood', 'could spare them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now', 'understood her sister, and saw to what indifference to', 'almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness', 'to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct', 'opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her', \"mother's decision, from whom however she scarcely expected\", 'to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit,', 'which she could not approve of for Marianne, and which', 'on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid.', 'Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her mother would be eager', 'to promote--she could not expect to influence the latter', 'to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she', 'had never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she', 'dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination', 'for going to London.  That Marianne, fastidious as she was,', \"thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings' manners,\", 'and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every', 'inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever', 'must be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her', 'pursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong,', 'so full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor,', 'in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to witness.', 'On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood,', 'persuaded that such an excursion would be productive', 'of much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving', 'through all her affectionate attention to herself,', 'how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear', 'of their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on', 'their both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee,', 'with her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that', 'would accrue to them all, from this separation.', '\"I am delighted with the plan,\" she cried,', '\"it is exactly what I could wish.

I have no such scruples,', 'and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness', 'of that kind with very little effort.\"', 'Elinor could not help smiling at this display of', 'indifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she', 'had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave', 'with tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself,', 'that if her sister persisted in going, she would', 'go likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne', 'should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment,', 'or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy', 'of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours.', 'To this determination she was the more easily reconciled,', \"by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account,\", 'was not to be in town before February; and that', 'their visit, without any unreasonable abridgement,', 'might be previously finished.', '\"I will have you BOTH go,\" said Mrs. Dashwood;', '\"these objections are nonsensical.  You will have much', 'pleasure in being in London, and especially in being together;', 'and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment,', 'she would foresee it there from a variety of sources;', 'she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her', 'acquaintance with her sister-in-law\\'s family.\"', 'Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of', \"attempting to weaken her mother's dependence on the\", 'attachment of Edward and herself, that the shock might', 'be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now', 'on this attack, though almost hopeless of success,', 'she forced herself to begin her design by saying,', 'as calmly as she could, \"I like Edward Ferrars very much,', 'and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest', 'of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference', 'to me, whether I am ever known to them or not.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.', 'Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor', 'conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue.', 'After very little farther discourse, it was finally', 'settled that the invitation should be fully accepted.', 'Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great', 'deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care;', 'nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.  Sir John', 'was delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety', 'was the dread of being alone, the acquisition of two,', 'to the number of inhabitants in London, was something.', 'Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted,', 'which was putting herself rather out of her way;', 'and as for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had', 'never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence', 'made them.', 'Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted', 'her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected', 'to feel.  With regard to herself, it was now a matter', 'of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and when', 'she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan,', 'and her sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner,', 'restored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more', 'than her usual gaiety, she could not be dissatisfied', 'with the cause, and would hardly allow herself to distrust', 'the consequence.', \"Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness,\", 'so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her', 'impatience to be gone.  Her unwillingness to quit her', 'mother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the', 'moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.', \"Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor\", 'was the only one of the three, who seemed to consider', 'the separation as any thing short of eternal.', 'Their departure took place in the first week in January.', 'The Middletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss', 'Steeles kept their station at the park, and were to quit', 'it only with the rest of the family.', 'CHAPTER 26', 'Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings,', 'and beginning a journey to London under her protection,', 'and as her guest, without wondering at her own situation,', 'so short had their acquaintance with that lady been,', 'so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition,', 'and so many had been her objections against such a measure', 'only a few days before! But these objections had all,', 'with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother', 'equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor,', \"in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy,\", 'could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation', 'which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes', 'of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect,', 'how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison,', 'and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of', \"Marianne's situation to have the same animating object\", 'in view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, a very', \"short time however must now decide what Willoughby's\", 'intentions were; in all probability he was already in town.', \"Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence\", 'on finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon', 'gaining every new light as to his character which her', 'own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,', 'but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister', 'with such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was', 'and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.', 'Should the result of her observations be unfavourable,', 'she was determined at all events to open the eyes', 'of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions', 'would be of a different nature--she must then learn', 'to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret', 'which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.', \"They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's\", 'behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what', 'future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings', 'might be expected to be.  She sat in silence almost all', 'the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever', 'voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque', 'beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation', 'of delight exclusively addressed to her sister.  To atone', 'for this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate possession', 'of the post of civility which she had assigned herself,', 'behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,', 'talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her', 'whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side', 'treated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous', 'on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only', 'disturbed that she could not make them choose their own', 'dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their', 'preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.', \"They reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to\", 'be released, after such a journey, from the confinement', 'of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.', 'The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up,', 'and the young ladies were immediately put in possession', 'of a very comfortable apartment.  It had formerly', \"been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung\", 'a landscape in coloured silks of her performance,', 'in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school', 'in town to some effect.', 'As dinner was not to be ready in less than two', 'hours from their arrival, Elinor determined to employ', 'the interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for', 'that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne did the same.', '\"I am writing home, Marianne,\" said Elinor; \"had not you', 'better defer your letter for a day or two?\"', '\"I am NOT going to write to my mother,\"', 'replied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid', 'any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it immediately', 'struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;', 'and the conclusion which as instantly followed was,', 'that, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct', 'the affair, they must be engaged.  This conviction,', 'though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure,', 'and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.', \"Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes;\", 'in length it could be no more than a note; it was then', 'folded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity.', 'Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in', 'the direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne,', 'ringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it', 'to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post.', 'This decided the matter at once.', 'Her spirits still continued very high; but there', 'was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much', 'pleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as', 'the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any dinner,', 'and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room,', 'seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.', 'It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings,', 'by being much engaged in her own room, could see little', 'of what was passing.  The tea things were brought in,', 'and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once', 'by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly', 'heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house,', \"Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach,\", 'and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door.', 'Every thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds;', 'she opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs,', 'and after listening half a minute, returned into the room', 'in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard', 'him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her', 'feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming,', '\"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed', 'almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel', 'Brandon appeared.', 'It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness,', 'and she immediately left the room.  Elinor was disappointed too;', 'but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured', 'his welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that', 'a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she', 'experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him.', 'She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him,', 'that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room,', 'with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him', 'the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.', '\"Is your sister ill?\" said he.', 'Elinor answered in some distress that she was,', 'and then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues;', 'and of every thing to which she could decently attribute', \"her sister's behaviour.\", 'He heard her with the most earnest attention,', 'but seeming to recollect himself, said no more on the subject,', 'and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them', 'in London, making the usual inquiries about their journey,', 'and the friends they had left behind.', 'In this calm kind of way, with very little interest', 'on either side, they continued to talk, both of them out', 'of spirits, and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere.', 'Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were', 'then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain', 'by any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way', 'of saying something, she asked if he had been in London', 'ever since she had seen him last.  \"Yes,\" he replied,', 'with some embarrassment, \"almost ever since; I have been', 'once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never', 'been in my power to return to Barton.\"', 'This, and the manner in which it was said,', 'immediately brought back to her remembrance all the', 'circumstances of his quitting that place, with the', 'uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings,', 'and she was fearful that her question had implied', 'much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt.', 'Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  \"Oh!

Mary always', 'has her own way.\"', '\"And now,\" silently conjectured Elinor, \"she will', 'write to Combe by this day\\'s post.\"', 'But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away', 'with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain', 'the fact.  Whatever the truth of it might be, and far', 'as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it,', 'yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could not be', 'very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits;', 'happy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier', 'in her expectation of a frost.', 'The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at', \"the houses of Mrs. Jennings's acquaintance to inform\", 'them of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time', 'busy in observing the direction of the wind, watching the', 'variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.', '\"Don\\'t you find it colder than it was in the morning,', 'Elinor? There seems to me a very decided difference.', 'I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff.  It was', 'not so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seem parting too,', 'the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a', 'clear afternoon.\"', 'Elinor was alternately diverted and pained;', 'but Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the', 'brightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance', 'of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.', 'The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be', \"dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and set\", 'of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves,', 'which was invariably kind.  Every thing in her household', 'arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan,', 'and excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady', \"Middleton's regret, she had never dropped, she visited\", 'no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose', 'the feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to find', 'herself more comfortably situated in that particular than', 'she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound', 'for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their', 'evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad,', 'formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.', 'Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation', 'to the house, was with them almost every day; he came', 'to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived', 'more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any', 'other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time', 'with much concern his continued regard for her sister.', 'She feared it was a strengthening regard.  It grieved her', 'to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne,', 'and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton.', 'About a week after their arrival, it became', 'certain that Willoughby was also arrived.  His card', \"was on the table when they came in from the morning's drive.\", '\"Good God!\" cried Marianne, \"he has been here while', 'we were out.\"  Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his', 'being in London, now ventured to say, \"Depend upon it,', 'he will call again tomorrow.\"  But Marianne seemed', \"hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenning's entrance,\", 'escaped with the precious card.', 'This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor,', 'restored to those of her sister all, and more than all,', 'their former agitation.  From this moment her mind was', 'never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour', 'of the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted', 'on being left behind, the next morning, when the others', 'went out.', \"Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing\", \"in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment's\", 'glance at her sister when they returned was enough to', 'inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there.', 'A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table,', '\"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.', '\"No, ma\\'am, for my mistress.\"', 'But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.', '\"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\"', '\"You are expecting a letter, then?\" said Elinor,', 'unable to be longer silent.', '\"Yes, a little--not much.\"', 'After a short pause.  \"You have no confidence', 'in me, Marianne.\"', '\"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have', 'confidence in no one!\"', '\"Me!\" returned Elinor in some confusion; \"indeed,', 'Marianne, I have nothing to tell.\"', '\"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations', 'then are alike.  We have neither of us any thing to tell;', 'you, because you do not communicate, and I, because', 'I conceal nothing.\"', 'Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself,', 'which she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how,', 'under such circumstances, to press for greater openness', 'in Marianne.', 'Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being', 'given her, she read it aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton,', 'announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before,', 'and requesting the company of her mother and cousins', \"the following evening.  Business on Sir John's part,\", 'and a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling', 'in Berkeley Street.  The invitation was accepted;', 'but when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as', 'it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that they', 'should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some', 'difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still', 'she had seen nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was', 'not more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling', 'to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.', 'Elinor found, when the evening was over,', 'that disposition is not materially altered by a change', 'of abode, for although scarcely settled in town,', 'Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty', 'young people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was', 'an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.', 'In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;', 'but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more', 'important and less easily attained, it was risking too much', 'for the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that', 'Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple,', 'with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.', 'Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former,', 'whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town,', 'as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention', 'to his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her,', 'they received no mark of recognition on their entrance.', 'He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know', 'who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from', 'the other side of the room.  Marianne gave one glance', 'round the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE', 'was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed', 'to receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been', 'assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards', 'the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them', 'in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first informed', 'of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said', 'something very droll on hearing that they were to come.', '\"I thought you were both in Devonshire,\" said he.', '\"Did you?\" replied Elinor.', '\"When do you go back again?\"', '\"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.', 'Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance', 'in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much', 'fatigued by the exercise.  She complained of it', 'as they returned to Berkeley Street.', '\"Aye, aye,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"we know the reason', 'of all that very well; if a certain person who shall', 'be nameless, had been there, you would not have been a', 'bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty', 'of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"', '\"Invited!\" cried Marianne.', '\"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir', 'John met him somewhere in the street this morning.\"', 'Marianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt.', 'Impatient in this situation to be doing something', \"that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved\", 'to write the next morning to her mother, and hoped', 'by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne,', 'to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed;', 'and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure', 'by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne', 'was again writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose', 'it to be to any other person.', 'About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by', 'herself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly,', 'while Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious', 'for conversation, walked from one window to the other,', 'or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.', 'Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother,', 'relating all that had passed, her suspicions of', \"Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her by every plea\", 'of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account', 'of her real situation with respect to him.', 'Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap', 'foretold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced.', 'Marianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated', 'company of any kind, left the room before he entered it.', 'He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing', 'satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he', 'had somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some', 'time without saying a word.  Elinor, persuaded that he', 'had some communication to make in which her sister', 'was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.', 'It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind', 'of conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with', 'the observation of \"your sister looks unwell to-day,\"', 'or \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had appeared', 'on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,', 'something particular about her.  After a pause of several', 'minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her', 'in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate', 'her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not', 'prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready,', 'was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient,', 'of asking what he meant?  He tried to smile as he replied,', '\"your sister\\'s engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally', 'known.\"', '\"It cannot be generally known,\" returned Elinor,', '\"for her own family do not know it.\"', 'He looked surprised and said, \"I beg your pardon,', 'I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not', 'supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond,', 'and their marriage is universally talked of.\"', '\"How can that be? By whom can you have heard', 'it mentioned?\"', '\"By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others', 'with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer,', 'and the Middletons.  But still I might not have believed it,', 'for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to', 'be convinced, it will always find something to support', 'its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,', 'accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to', \"Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing.  I came to inquire,\", 'but I was convinced before I could ask the question.', 'Is every thing finally settled?  Is it impossible to-?', 'But I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding.', 'Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong', 'in saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on', 'your prudence I have the strongest dependence.  Tell me', 'that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt,', 'that in short concealment, if concealment be possible,', 'is all that remains.\"', 'These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal', 'of his love for her sister, affected her very much.', 'She was not immediately able to say anything, and even', 'when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short', 'time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.', 'The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister', 'was so little known to herself, that in endeavouring', 'to explain it, she might be as liable to say too much', \"as too little.  Yet as she was convinced that Marianne's\", 'affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel', \"Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection\", 'might be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct', 'from censure, she thought it most prudent and kind,', 'after some consideration, to say more than she really knew', 'or believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that though', 'she had never been informed by themselves of the terms', 'on which they stood with each other, of their mutual', 'affection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence', 'she was not astonished to hear.', 'He listened to her with silent attention, and on', 'her ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat,', 'and after saying in a voice of emotion, \"to your sister', 'I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he', 'may endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away.', 'Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this', 'conversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on', 'other points; she was left, on the contrary, with a', \"melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's unhappiness,\", 'and was prevented even from wishing it removed,', 'by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.', 'CHAPTER 28', 'Nothing occurred during the next three or four days,', 'to make Elinor regret what she had done, in applying', 'to her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote.', 'They were engaged about the end of that time to attend', 'Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was', 'kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter;', 'and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited,', 'careless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent', 'whether she went or staid, prepared, without one look', 'of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the', 'drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady', \"Middleton's arrival, without once stirring from her seat,\", 'or altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts,', \"and insensible of her sister's presence; and when at\", 'last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them', 'at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that', 'any one was expected.', 'They arrived in due time at the place of destination,', 'and as soon as the string of carriages before them', 'would allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their', 'names announced from one landing-place to another in an', 'audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,', 'quite full of company, and insufferably hot.  When they had', 'paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady', 'of the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd,', 'and take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to', 'which their arrival must necessarily add.  After some time', 'spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat', 'down to Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for', 'moving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs,', 'placed themselves at no great distance from the table.', 'They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor', 'perceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards', 'of them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable', 'looking young woman.  She soon caught his eye, and he', 'immediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her,', 'or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;', 'and then continued his discourse with the same lady.', 'Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether', 'it could be unobserved by her.  At that moment she first', 'perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with', 'sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly,', 'had not her sister caught hold of her.', '\"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed, \"he is there--he', 'is there--Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot', 'I speak to him?\"', '\"Pray, pray be composed,\" cried Elinor, \"and do', 'not betray what you feel to every body present.', 'Perhaps he has not observed you yet.\"', 'This however was more than she could believe herself;', 'and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond', 'the reach of Marianne, it was beyond her wish.  She sat', 'in an agony of impatience which affected every feature.', 'At last he turned round again, and regarded them both;', 'she started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone', 'of affection, held out her hand to him.  He approached,', 'and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne,', 'as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to', 'observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after', 'Mrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town.', 'Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address,', 'and was unable to say a word.  But the feelings of her sister', 'were instantly expressed.  Her face was crimsoned over,', 'and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,', '\"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?', 'Have you not received my letters?  Will you not shake', 'hands with me?\"', 'He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed', 'painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.', 'During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure.', 'Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression', \"becoming more tranquil.  After a moment's pause, he spoke\", 'with calmness.', '\"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley', 'Street last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was', 'not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings', 'at home.  My card was not lost, I hope.\"', '\"But have you not received my notes?\" cried Marianne', 'in the wildest anxiety.  \"Here is some mistake I am', 'sure--some dreadful mistake.  What can be the meaning', \"of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me,\", 'what is the matter?\"', 'He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his', 'embarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye', 'of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking,', 'he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered', 'himself again, and after saying, \"Yes, I had the pleasure', 'of receiving the information of your arrival in town,', 'which you were so good as to send me,\" turned hastily away', 'with a slight bow and joined his friend.', 'Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable', 'to stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every', 'moment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the', 'observation of others, while reviving her with lavender water.', '\"Go to him, Elinor,\" she cried, as soon as she', 'could speak, \"and force him to come to me.  Tell him', 'I must see him again--must speak to him instantly.--', \"I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till this\", 'is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.--', 'Oh go to him this moment.\"', '\"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne,', 'you must wait.  This is not the place for explanations.', 'Wait only till tomorrow.\"', 'With difficulty however could she prevent her', 'from following him herself; and to persuade her to check', 'her agitation, to wait, at least, with the appearance', 'of composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy', 'and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued', 'incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery', 'of her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness.', 'In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the', 'door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he', 'was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again', 'that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.', 'She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady', 'Middleton to take them home, as she was too miserable', 'to stay a minute longer.', 'Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber,', 'on being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too', 'polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away,', 'and making over her cards to a friend, they departed', 'as soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word', 'was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.', 'Marianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even', 'for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home,', 'they could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn', 'restored her a little to herself.  She was soon undressed', 'and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone,', 'her sister then left her, and while she waited the return', 'of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over', 'the past.', 'That some kind of engagement had subsisted', 'between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt,', 'and that Willoughby was weary of it, seemed equally clear;', 'for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes,', 'SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake', 'or misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough', 'change of sentiment could account for it.  Her indignation', 'would have been still stronger than it was, had she', 'not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak', 'a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented', 'her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been', 'sporting with the affections of her sister from the first,', 'without any design that would bear investigation.', 'Absence might have weakened his regard, and convenience', 'might have determined him to overcome it, but that such', 'a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself', 'to doubt.', 'As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting', 'must already have given her, and on those still more', 'severe which might await her in its probable consequence,', 'she could not reflect without the deepest concern.', 'Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she', 'could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be', 'divided in future, her mind might be always supported.', 'But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil', 'seemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne', 'in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate', 'and irreconcilable rupture with him.', 'CHAPTER 29', 'Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day,', 'or the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning', 'in January, Marianne, only half dressed, was kneeling', 'against one of the window-seats for the sake of all', 'the little light she could command from it, and writing', 'as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her.', 'In this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation', 'and sobs, first perceived her; and after observing her', 'for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone', 'of the most considerate gentleness,', '\"Marianne, may I ask-?\"', '\"No, Elinor,\" she replied, \"ask nothing; you will', 'soon know all.\"', 'The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said,', 'lasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately', 'followed by a return of the same excessive affliction.', 'It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter,', 'and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her,', 'at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her', 'feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing', 'for the last time to Willoughby.', 'Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention', 'in her power; and she would have tried to sooth and', 'tranquilize her still more, had not Marianne entreated her,', 'with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability,', 'not to speak to her for the world.  In such circumstances,', 'it was better for both that they should not be long together;', \"and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented\", 'her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed,', 'but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place,', 'made her wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding', 'the sight of every body.', 'At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat', \"any thing; and Elinor's attention was then all employed,\", 'not in urging her, not in pitying her, nor in appearing', \"to regard her, but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning's\", 'notice entirely to herself.', 'As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings,', 'it lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting', 'themselves, after it, round the common working table, when a', 'letter was delivered to Marianne, which she eagerly caught', 'from the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness,', 'instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw as plainly', 'by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must', 'come from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness', 'at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head,', 'and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it', \"impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning's notice.  That good lady,\", 'however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter', 'from Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke,', 'and which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh,', \"that she would find it to her liking.  Of Elinor's distress,\", 'she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted', 'for her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing', 'her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,', '\"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so', 'desperately in love in my life!  MY girls were nothing', 'to her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as', 'for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.', \"I hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her\", 'waiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her', 'look so ill and forlorn.  Pray, when are they to be married?\"', 'Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at', 'that moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack', 'as this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, \"And have', \"you really, Ma'am, talked yourself into a persuasion\", \"of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  I thought\", 'it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems', 'to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not', 'deceive yourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing', 'would surprise me more than to hear of their being going', 'to be married.\"', '\"For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you', \"talk so?  Don't we all know that it must be a match, that\", 'they were over head and ears in love with each other from', 'the first moment they met?  Did not I see them together', 'in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I', 'know that your sister came to town with me on purpose', \"to buy wedding clothes?  Come, come, this won't do.\", 'Because you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody', 'else has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you,', 'for it has been known all over town this ever so long.', 'I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.\"', '\"Indeed, Ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, very seriously,', '\"you are mistaken.  Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing', 'in spreading the report, and you will find that you have', 'though you will not believe me now.\"', 'Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not', 'spirits to say more, and eager at all events to know', 'what Willoughby had written, hurried away to their room,', 'where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne stretched on', 'the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,', 'and two or three others laying by her.  Elinor drew near,', 'but without saying a word; and seating herself on the bed,', 'took her hand, kissed her affectionately several times,', 'and then gave way to a burst of tears, which at first', \"was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The latter,\", 'though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness', 'of this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in', \"joint affliction, she put all the letters into Elinor's hands;\", 'and then covering her face with her handkerchief,', 'almost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew that such grief,', 'shocking as it was to witness it, must have its course,', 'watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat', \"spent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter,\", 'read as follows:', '                              \"Bond Street, January.', '     \"MY DEAR MADAM,', '     \"I have just had the honour of receiving your', '     letter, for which I beg to return my sincere', '     acknowledgments.

This seems to have been a day of general', 'elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us.', 'Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?\"', '\"In a stationer\\'s shop in Pall Mall, where I', 'had business.  Two ladies were waiting for their carriage,', 'and one of them was giving the other an account of the', 'intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,', 'that it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The name', 'of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated,', 'first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive', 'assertion that every thing was now finally settled', 'respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was no longer', 'to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,', 'with many particulars of preparations and other matters.', 'One thing, especially, I remember, because it served', 'to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony', 'was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat', 'in Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but it would be', 'impossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative', 'lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop', 'till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I', 'have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey\\'s guardian.\"', '\"It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey', 'has fifty thousand pounds?  In that, if in any thing,', 'we may find an explanation.\"', '\"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least', 'I think\"--he stopped a moment; then added in a voice', 'which seemed to distrust itself, \"And your sister--', 'how did she--\"', '\"Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have', 'only to hope that they may be proportionately short.', 'It has been, it is a most cruel affliction.  Till yesterday,', 'I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now,', 'perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was', 'really attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and,', 'in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\"', '\"Ah!\" said Colonel Brandon, \"there is, indeed!  But', 'your sister does not--I think you said so--she does', 'not consider quite as you do?\"', '\"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly', 'she would still justify him if she could.\"', 'He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal', 'of the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties,', 'the subject was necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had', 'watched them with pleasure while they were talking, and who', \"expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood's communication,\", \"in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon's side,\", 'as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of hope', 'and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole', 'evening more serious and thoughtful than usual.', 'CHAPTER 31', 'From a night of more sleep than she had expected,', 'Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness', 'of misery in which she had closed her eyes.', 'Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk', 'of what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had', 'gone through the subject again and again; and with the same', \"steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor's side,\", 'the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on', \"Marianne's, as before.  Sometimes she could believe\", 'Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself,', 'and at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility', 'of acquitting him.  At one moment she was absolutely', 'indifferent to the observation of all the world, at another', 'she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third', 'could resist it with energy.  In one thing, however,', 'she was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding,', 'where it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings,', 'and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it.', \"Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings's\", 'entering into her sorrows with any compassion.', '\"No, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried;', '\"she cannot feel.  Her kindness is not sympathy;', 'her good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she wants', 'is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\"', 'Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice', 'to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others,', 'by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too', 'great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a', 'strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.', 'Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there', 'be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent', 'abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither', 'reasonable nor candid.  She expected from other people', 'the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged', 'of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions', 'on herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the', 'sisters were together in their own room after breakfast,', 'which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower', 'in her estimation; because, through her own weakness,', 'it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,', 'though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse', 'of the utmost goodwill.', 'With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance', 'gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,', 'she entered their room, saying,', '\"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure', 'will do you good.\"', 'Marianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination', 'placed before her a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness', 'and contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory,', 'convincing; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself,', 'rushing eagerly into the room to inforce, at her feet,', 'by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter.', 'The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.', 'The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome,', 'was before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment', 'which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope,', 'she felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered.', 'The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within', 'her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence,', 'could have expressed; and now she could reproach her', 'only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with', 'passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely', 'lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity,', 'she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.', 'But the letter, when she was calm enough to read it,', 'brought little comfort.  Willoughby filled every page.', 'Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying', 'as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused', \"by Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater\", 'openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness', 'towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such', 'a conviction of their future happiness in each other,', 'that she wept with agony through the whole of it.', 'All her impatience to be at home again now returned;', 'her mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through', 'the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby,', 'and she was wildly urgent to be gone.  Elinor, unable herself', 'to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be', 'in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own', \"except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known;\", \"and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait\", 'for that knowledge.', 'Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she', 'could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able', 'to grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing', \"Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for the rest\", 'of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of', 'the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving,', \"by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying\", 'any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother', 'an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions', 'for the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room', \"on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table\", 'where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen,', 'grieving over her for the hardship of such a task,', 'and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.', 'In this manner they had continued about a quarter', 'of an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then', 'bear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.', '\"Who can this be?\" cried Elinor.  \"So early too! I', 'thought we HAD been safe.\"', 'Marianne moved to the window--', '\"It is Colonel Brandon!\" said she, with vexation.', '\"We are never safe from HIM.\"', '\"He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.\"', '\"I will not trust to THAT,\" retreating to her own room.', '\"A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no', 'conscience in his intrusion on that of others.\"', 'The event proved her conjecture right, though it', 'was founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon', 'DID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that', 'solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw', 'THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,', 'and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her,', 'could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly.', '\"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,\" said he,', 'after the first salutation, \"and she encouraged me', 'to come on; and I was the more easily encouraged,', 'because I thought it probable that I might find you alone,', 'which I was very desirous of doing.  My object--my', 'wish--my sole wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe', 'it is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, I must', 'not say comfort--not present comfort--but conviction,', \"lasting conviction to your sister's mind.  My regard for her,\", 'for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it,', 'by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY', 'sincere regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being', 'useful--I think I am justified--though where so many hours', 'have been spent in convincing myself that I am right,', 'is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?\"', 'He stopped.', '\"I understand you,\" said Elinor.  \"You have something', 'to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character', 'farther.  Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship', 'that can be shewn Marianne.  MY gratitude will be insured', 'immediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS', 'must be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let me hear it.\"', '\"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton', 'last October,--but this will give you no idea--I must go', 'farther back.  You will find me a very awkward narrator,', 'Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.  A short', 'account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it', 'SHALL be a short one.  On such a subject,\" sighing heavily,', '\"can I have little temptation to be diffuse.\"', 'He stopt a moment for recollection, and then,', 'with another sigh, went on.', '\"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--', '(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression', 'on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton', 'Park--it was the evening of a dance--in which I alluded', 'to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure,', 'your sister Marianne.\"', '\"Indeed,\" answered Elinor, \"I have NOT forgotten it.\"', 'He looked pleased by this remembrance, and added,', '\"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality', 'of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance', 'between them, as well in mind as person.  The same warmth', 'of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits.', 'This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from', 'her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.', 'Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years', 'we were playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the', 'time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her,', 'as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my', 'present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me', \"incapable of having ever felt.  Her's, for me, was, I believe,\", 'fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby', 'and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.', 'At seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was', 'married--married against her inclination to my brother.', 'Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.', 'And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the', 'conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.', 'My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.', 'I had hoped that her regard for me would support her', 'under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at', 'last the misery of her situation, for she experienced', 'great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though', 'she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I', 'relate!  I have never told you how this was brought on.', 'We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland.', \"The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us.\", 'I was banished to the house of a relation far distant,', 'and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,', \"till my father's point was gained.  I had depended on her\", 'fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--', 'but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was,', 'a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least', 'I should not have now to lament it.  This however', 'was not the case.  My brother had no regard for her;', 'his pleasures were not what they ought to have been,', 'and from the first he treated her unkindly.  The consequence', 'of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced', \"as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.  She resigned\", 'herself at first to all the misery of her situation;', 'and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those', 'regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we', 'wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy,', 'and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for', 'my father lived only a few months after their marriage,', 'and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she', 'should fall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I', 'meant to promote the happiness of both by removing', 'from her for years, and for that purpose had procured', 'my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,\"', 'he continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of', 'trifling weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard,', 'about two years afterwards, of her divorce.  It was', 'THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection', 'of what I suffered--\"', 'He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few', 'minutes about the room.  Elinor, affected by his relation,', 'and still more by his distress, could not speak.  He saw', 'her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it,', 'and kissed it with grateful respect.  A few minutes more', 'of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.', '\"It was nearly three years after this unhappy', 'period before I returned to England.  My first care,', 'when I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her;', 'but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.', 'I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there', 'was every reason to fear that she had removed from him', 'only to sink deeper in a life of sin.  Her legal allowance', 'was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her', 'comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that', 'the power of receiving it had been made over some months', 'before to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he', 'imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress,', 'had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief.', 'At last, however, and after I had been six months in England,', 'I DID find her.  Regard for a former servant of my own,', 'who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit', 'him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt;', 'and there, the same house, under a similar confinement,', 'was my unfortunate sister.  So altered--so faded--worn', 'down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I', 'believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me,', 'to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,', 'on whom I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding', 'her--but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting', 'to describe it--I have pained you too much already.', 'That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage', 'of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was', 'my greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her,', 'beyond giving time for a better preparation for death;', 'and that was given.  I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,', 'and under proper attendants; I visited her every day', 'during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her', 'last moments.\"', 'Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor', 'spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern,', 'at the fate of his unfortunate friend.', '\"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,\" said he,', '\"by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my', 'poor disgraced relation.  Their fates, their fortunes,', 'cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet', 'disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind,', 'or a happier marriage, she might have been all that you', 'will live to see the other be.  But to what does all this', 'lead?  I seem to have been distressing you for nothing.', 'Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched', 'for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!', 'I WILL be more collected--more concise.  She left to my care', 'her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first', 'guilty connection, who was then about three years old.', 'She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.', 'It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly', 'would I have discharged it in the strictest sense,', 'by watching over her education myself, had the nature', 'of our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home;', 'and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school.', 'I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my', 'brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which', 'left to me the possession of the family property,) she', 'visited me at Delaford.  I called her a distant relation;', 'but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected', 'of a much nearer connection with her.  It is now three', 'years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,)', 'that I removed her from school, to place her under the care', 'of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,', 'who had the charge of four or five other girls of about', 'the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason', 'to be pleased with her situation.  But last February,', 'almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.', 'I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned', 'out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of', 'her young friends, who was attending her father there', 'for his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,', 'and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,', 'for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy,', 'she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she', 'certainly knew all.  He, her father, a well-meaning,', 'but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,', 'give no information; for he had been generally confined', 'to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town', 'and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried', 'to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself,', \"of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business.\", 'In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone;', 'all the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.', 'What I thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I', 'suffered too.\"', '\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"could it be--could', 'Willoughby!\"--', '\"The first news that reached me of her,\" he continued,', '\"came in a letter from herself, last October.', 'It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it', 'on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell;', 'and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,', 'which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange', 'to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some.', 'Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his', 'looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party,', 'that I was called away to the relief of one whom he', 'had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it,', 'what would it have availed?  Would he have been less', 'gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?  No,', 'he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel', 'for another would do.  He had left the girl whose', 'youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of', 'the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,', 'no friends, ignorant of his address!  He had left her,', 'promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote,', 'nor relieved her.\"', '\"This is beyond every thing!\" exclaimed Elinor.', '\"His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated,', 'and worse than both.  Knowing all this, as I have now', 'known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing', 'your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured', 'that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt', 'for all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and', 'found you alone, I came determined to know the truth;', 'though irresolute what to do when it WAS known.', 'My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then;', 'but now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be', 'so deceived; to see your sister--but what could I do?', 'I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes', \"I thought your sister's influence might yet reclaim him.\", 'But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what', 'were his designs on her.  Whatever they may have been,', 'however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL', 'turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she', 'compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers', 'the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl,', 'and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong,', 'still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented', 'by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.', 'Surely this comparison must have its use with her.', 'She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They', 'proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.', 'On the contrary, every friend must be made still more', 'her friend by them.  Concern for her unhappiness,', 'and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen', 'every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however,', 'in communicating to her what I have told you.  You must', 'know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously,', 'and from my heart believed it might be of service,', 'might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered', 'myself to trouble you with this account of my family', 'afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been', 'intended to raise myself at the expense of others.\"', \"Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful\", 'earnestness; attended too with the assurance of her', 'expecting material advantage to Marianne, from the', 'communication of what had passed.', '\"I have been more pained,\" said she, \"by her', 'endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it', 'irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction', 'of his unworthiness can do.  Now, though at first she', 'will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.', 'Have you,\" she continued, after a short silence,', '\"ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton?\"', '\"Yes,\" he replied gravely, \"once I have.  One meeting', 'was unavoidable.\"', 'Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously,', 'saying,', '\"What? have you met him to--\"', '\"I could meet him no other way.  Eliza had confessed', 'to me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover;', 'and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight', 'after myself, we met by appointment, he to defend,', 'I to punish his conduct.  We returned unwounded,', 'and the meeting, therefore, never got abroad.\"', 'Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this;', 'but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it.', '\"Such,\" said Colonel Brandon, after a pause,', '\"has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother', 'and daughter! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust!\"', '\"Is she still in town?\"', '\"No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in,', 'for I found her near her delivery, I removed her and her', 'child into the country, and there she remains.\"', 'Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably', 'dividing Elinor from her sister, he put an end to his visit,', 'receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments,', 'and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him.', 'CHAPTER 32', 'When the particulars of this conversation were repeated', 'by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were,', 'the effect on her was not entirely such as the former', 'had hoped to see.  Not that Marianne appeared to distrust', 'the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all', 'with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither', 'objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby,', 'and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to', 'be impossible.  But though this behaviour assured Elinor', 'that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to', 'her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it,', 'in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,', 'in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking,', 'with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she', 'saw her spirits less violently irritated than before,', 'she did not see her less wretched.  Her mind did become', 'settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.', \"She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily\", 'than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and', 'desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl,', 'and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been', 'on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,', 'that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt', 'even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence,', 'gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated', 'by the most open and most frequent confession of them.', 'To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood', \"on receiving and answering Elinor's letter would be only\", 'to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt', 'and said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than', \"Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's.\", 'Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,', 'arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought;', 'to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat', 'she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune.', \"Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be,\", 'when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying', 'and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets,', 'which SHE could wish her not to indulge!', 'Against the interest of her own individual comfort,', 'Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for', 'Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton,', 'where every thing within her view would be bringing back', 'the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner,', 'by constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as', 'she had always seen him there.

It is not to be', 'supposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short,', 'you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite', 'out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--', 'you have too much sense not to see all that.

He has a most excellent mother.', 'Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward,', 'and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match', 'takes place.  The lady is the Hon.

A thousand a-year', 'is a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over', 'for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give', 'you another instance of her liberality:--The other day,', 'as soon as we came to town, aware that money could', 'not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes', \"into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds.\", 'And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great', 'expense while we are here.\"', 'He paused for her assent and compassion; and she', 'forced herself to say,', '\"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly', 'be considerable; but your income is a large one.\"', '\"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.', 'I do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly', 'a comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better.', 'The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,', 'is a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little', 'purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm,', 'you must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live.', 'The land was so very desirable for me in every respect,', 'so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it', 'my duty to buy it.

Our respected father,', 'as you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects', 'that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)', 'to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his', 'doing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his', 'own property as he chose, but, in consequence of it,', 'we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen,', 'china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away.', 'You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we', \"must be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's\", 'kindness is.\"', '\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality,', 'I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances.\"', '\"Another year or two may do much towards it,\"', 'he gravely replied; \"but however there is still a great', \"deal to be done.  There is not a stone laid of Fanny's\", 'green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden', 'marked out.\"', '\"Where is the green-house to be?\"', '\"Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old', 'walnut trees are all come down to make room for it.', 'It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park,', 'and the flower-garden will slope down just before it,', 'and be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old', 'thorns that grew in patches over the brow.\"', 'Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself;', 'and was very thankful that Marianne was not present,', 'to share the provocation.', 'Having now said enough to make his poverty clear,', 'and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings', \"for each of his sisters, in his next visit at Gray's\", 'his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began to', 'congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.', '\"She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house,', 'her style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income;', 'and it is an acquaintance that has not only been', 'of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove', 'materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is', 'certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it', 'speaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all', 'probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.--', 'She must have a great deal to leave.\"', '\"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has', 'only her jointure, which will descend to her children.\"', '\"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to', 'her income.

Whereas, in my opinion, by her', 'taking so much notice of you, and treating you in this', 'kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her', 'future consideration, which a conscientious woman would', 'not disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour;', 'and she can hardly do all this, without being aware', 'of the expectation it raises.\"', '\"But she raises none in those most concerned.', 'Indeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity', 'carries you too far.\"', '\"Why, to be sure,\" said he, seeming to recollect himself,', '\"people have little, have very little in their power.', 'But, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?--', 'she looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown', 'quite thin.

He had just compunction', 'enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself,', 'to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should', 'do a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon,', 'or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means', 'of atoning for his own neglect.', 'They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton', 'at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.', 'Abundance of civilities passed on all sides.

The consequence of which was,', 'that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only', 'to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her', 'carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse,', 'must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing', 'to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they', 'might not expect to go out with her a second time?  The power', \"of disappointing them, it was true, must always be her's.\", 'But that was not enough; for when people are determined', 'on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel', 'injured by the expectation of any thing better from them.', 'Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much', 'into the habit of going out every day, that it was become', 'a matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not:', 'and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every', \"evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest\", 'amusement from any, and very often without knowing,', 'till the last moment, where it was to take her.', 'To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly', 'indifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it,', 'during the whole of her toilet, which it received from', 'Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being', 'together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute', 'observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing,', 'and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price', \"of every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the\", 'number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than', 'Marianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out', 'before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,', 'and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.', 'The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover,', 'was generally concluded with a compliment, which', 'though meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne', 'as the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing', 'an examination into the value and make of her gown,', 'the colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair,', 'she was almost sure of being told that upon \"her word', 'she looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would', 'make a great many conquests.\"', 'With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed', \"on the present occasion, to her brother's carriage;\", 'which they were ready to enter five minutes after it', 'stopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable', 'to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house', 'of her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay', 'on their part that might inconvenience either herself', 'or her coachman.', 'The events of this evening were not very remarkable.', 'The party, like other musical parties, comprehended a', 'great many people who had real taste for the performance,', 'and a great many more who had none at all; and the performers', 'themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,', 'and that of their immediate friends, the first private', 'performers in England.', 'As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so,', 'she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand', 'pianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even', 'by the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix', 'them at pleasure on any other object in the room.  In one', 'of these excursive glances she perceived among a group', 'of young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture', \"on toothpick-cases at Gray's.  She perceived him soon\", 'afterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly', 'to her brother; and had just determined to find out his', 'name from the latter, when they both came towards her,', 'and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.', 'He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted', 'his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as', 'words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb', 'she had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy had', 'it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended', 'less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest', \"relations!  For then his brother's bow must have given\", 'the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother', 'and sister would have begun.  But while she wondered', 'at the difference of the two young men, she did not find', 'that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out', 'of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other.', 'Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself', \"in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation;\", 'for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme', 'GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing', 'in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it', 'much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune', 'of a private education; while he himself, though probably', 'without any particular, any material superiority', 'by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,', 'was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.', '\"Upon my soul,\" he added, \"I believe it is nothing more;', 'and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving', \"about it.  'My dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'you must\", 'make yourself easy.  The evil is now irremediable,', 'and it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would', 'you be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your', 'own judgment, to place Edward under private tuition,', 'at the most critical time of his life?  If you had only sent', 'him to Westminster as well as myself, instead of sending', \"him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been prevented.'\", 'This is the way in which I always consider the matter,', 'and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\"', 'Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because,', 'whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage', \"of a public school, she could not think of Edward's\", \"abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.\", '\"You reside in Devonshire, I think,\"--was his', 'next observation, \"in a cottage near Dawlish.\"', 'Elinor set him right as to its situation;', 'and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody', 'could live in Devonshire, without living near Dawlish.', 'He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their', 'species of house.', '\"For my own part,\" said he, \"I am excessively fond', 'of a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much', 'elegance about them.  And I protest, if I had any money', 'to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself,', 'within a short distance of London, where I might drive', 'myself down at any time, and collect a few friends', 'about me, and be happy.  I advise every body who is going', 'to build, to build a cottage.  My friend Lord Courtland', 'came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,', \"and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's.\", \"I was to decide on the best of them.  'My dear Courtland,'\", \"said I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, 'do not\", \"adopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.'\", 'And that I fancy, will be the end of it.', '\"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations,', 'no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake.', \"I was last month at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford.\", \"Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  'But how can it\", \"be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it\", 'is to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage', \"that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?'\", 'I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it,', \"so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy.\", 'The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;', 'card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library', 'may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the', \"supper be set out in the saloon.'  Lady Elliott was delighted\", 'with the thought.  We measured the dining-room, and found', 'it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair', 'was arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact,', 'you see, if people do but know how to set about it,', 'every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage', 'as in the most spacious dwelling.\"', 'Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think', 'he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.', 'As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his', 'eldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on', 'any thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening,', 'which he communicated to his wife, for her approbation,', \"when they got home.  The consideration of Mrs. Dennison's\", 'mistake,', 'in supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the', 'propriety of their being really invited to become such,', \"while Mrs. Jenning's engagements kept her from home.\", 'The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more;', 'and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy', 'of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its', 'complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father.', 'Fanny was startled at the proposal.', '\"I do not see how it can be done,\" said she,', '\"without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day', 'with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it.', 'You know I am always ready to pay them any attention', 'in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.', \"But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.  How can I ask them\", 'away from her?\"', 'Her husband, but with great humility, did not see', 'the force of her objection.  \"They had already spent a week', 'in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton', 'could not be displeased at their giving the same number', 'of days to such near relations.\"', 'Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,', '\"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it', 'was in my power.  But I had just settled within myself', 'to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us.', 'They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think', 'the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very', 'well by Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year,', 'you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.', 'I am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them,', 'you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they', 'are such favourites with Harry!\"', 'Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity', 'of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience', 'was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters', 'another year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting', 'that another year would make the invitation needless,', \"by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife,\", 'and Marianne as THEIR visitor.', 'Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready', 'wit that had procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy,', \"to request her company and her sister's, for some days,\", 'in Harley Street, as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them.', 'This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy.', 'Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself;', 'cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!', 'Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was,', 'above all things, the most material to her interest,', 'and such an invitation the most gratifying to her', 'feelings!  It was an advantage that could not be too', 'gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of;', 'and the visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had', 'any precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been', \"always meant to end in two days' time.\", 'When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten', 'minutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time,', 'some share in the expectations of Lucy; for such a mark', 'of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance,', 'seemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose', 'from something more than merely malice against herself;', 'and might be brought, by time and address, to do', 'every thing that Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already', 'subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry', 'into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and these', 'were effects that laid open the probability of greater.', 'The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all', 'that reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened', 'her expectation of the event.  Sir John, who called on', 'them more than once, brought home such accounts of the', 'favour they were in, as must be universally striking.', 'Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any', 'young women in her life, as she was with them; had given', 'each of them a needle book made by some emigrant;', 'called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know', 'whether she should ever be able to part with them.', '[At this point in the first and second edtions, Volume II ended.]', 'CHAPTER 37', 'Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight,', 'that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up', 'the whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with', 'visiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period', 'to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found', 'the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.', 'About the third or fourth morning after their', 'being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings,', 'on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer,', 'entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting', 'by herself, with an air of such hurrying importance', 'as prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her', 'time only to form that idea, began directly to justify it,', 'by saying,', '\"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?\"', '\"No, ma\\'am.  What is it?\"', '\"Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all.--', \"When I got to Mr. Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite\", 'in a fuss about the child.  She was sure it was very', 'ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.', \"So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,'\", \"says I, 'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum--'\", 'and nurse said just the same.  But Charlotte, she would', 'not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily', 'he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he', 'stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child,', 'be said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world', 'but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy.  And so,', 'just as he was going away again, it came into my head,', 'I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it,', 'but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.', 'So upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,', 'and seemed to know something or other, and at last he', \"said in a whisper, 'For fear any unpleasant report\", 'should reach the young ladies under your care as to their', \"sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say,\", 'that I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope', 'Mrs. Dashwood will do very well.\\'\"', '\"What! is Fanny ill?\"', '\"That is exactly what I said, my dear.  \\'Lord!\\' says I,', \"'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the\", 'long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn,', 'seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young', 'man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it', 'turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing', 'in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged', \"above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There's for you,\", 'my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter,', 'except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?--', 'There is no great wonder in their liking one another;', 'but that matters should be brought so forward between them,', 'and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened', 'to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it', 'out directly.  Well, and so this was kept a great secret,', 'for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your', 'brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--', 'till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a', 'well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.', \"'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are all so fond\", \"of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;'\", 'and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all', 'alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to', 'come--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five', 'minutes before, that she thought to make a match between', \"Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who.\", 'So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity', 'and pride.  She fell into violent hysterics immediately,', \"with such screams as reached your brother's ears,\", 'as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs,', 'thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country.', 'So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place,', 'for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming', 'what was going on.  Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say,', 'I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded', 'like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit.', 'Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;', 'and your brother, he walked about the room, and said', 'he did not know what to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared', 'they should not stay a minute longer in the house,', 'and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too,', 'to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed', 'up their clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again,', 'and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,', 'and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar.', 'The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor', 'cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he', 'came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,', 'she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad.', 'I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,', 'with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.', 'Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he', 'hears of it!  To have his love used so scornfully! for', 'they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may.', 'I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest', 'passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I', 'had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is,', 'that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may', 'be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she', 'was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,', 'for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;', 'and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for', \"either of them.  I have no notion of people's making\", 'such a to-do about money and greatness.  There is no', 'reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry;', 'for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well', 'by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself,', 'she knows better than any body how to make the most', 'of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only', 'allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good', 'an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.', 'Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage', 'as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men;', 'and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my', 'Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them', 'exactly.\"', 'Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had', 'time enough to collect her thoughts, she was able', 'to give such an answer, and make such observations,', 'as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.', 'Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary', 'interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late', 'often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her', 'at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest,', 'in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able', 'to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to', 'give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality', 'on the conduct of every one concerned in it.', 'She could hardly determine what her own expectation', 'of its event really was; though she earnestly tried', 'to drive away the notion of its being possible to end', 'otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy.', 'What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could', 'not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear;', 'and still more anxious to know how Edward would', 'conduct himself.  For HIM she felt much compassion;--', 'for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure', 'that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.', 'As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject,', 'Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for', 'its discussion.  No time was to be lost in undeceiving her,', 'in making her acquainted with the real truth, and in', 'endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,', 'without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister,', 'or any resentment against Edward.', \"Elinor's office was a painful one.--She was going\", \"to remove what she really believed to be her sister's\", 'chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she', 'feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and', 'to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,', 'which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own', 'disappointment over again.  But unwelcome as such a task', 'must be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore', 'hastened to perform it.', 'She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own', 'feelings, or to represent herself as suffering much,', 'any otherwise than as the self-command she had practised', \"since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement, might\", 'suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.', 'Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could', 'not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied', 'by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged', 'rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror,', 'and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the comforter', 'of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs;', 'and all the comfort that could be given by assurances', 'of her own composure of mind, and a very earnest', 'vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence,', 'was readily offered.', 'But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.', 'Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging', 'as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely,', 'could she feel less than herself!  As for Lucy Steele,', 'she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely', 'incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could', 'not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards', 'to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her.', 'She would not even admit it to have been natural;', 'and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so,', 'by that which only could convince her, a better knowledge', 'of mankind.', 'Her first communication had reached no farther than', 'to state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time', \"it had existed.--Marianne's feelings had then broken in,\", 'and put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some', 'time all that could be done was to soothe her distress,', 'lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first', 'question on her side, which led to farther particulars,', 'was,', '\"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has', 'he written to you?\"', '\"I have known it these four months.  When Lucy', 'first came to Barton Park last November, she told me', 'in confidence of her engagement.\"', \"At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment\", 'which her lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder,', 'she exclaimed--', '\"Four months!--Have you known of this four months?\"', 'Elinor confirmed it.', '\"What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this', 'been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being', 'happy!\"--', '\"It was not fit that you should then know how much', 'I was the reverse!\"', '\"Four months!\"--cried Marianne again.--\"So calm!--', 'so cheerful!--how have you been supported?\"--', '\"By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to', 'Lucy, obliged me to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore,', 'to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my', 'family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me,', 'which it could not be in my power to satisfy.\"', 'Marianne seemed much struck.', '\"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my', 'mother,\" added Elinor; \"and once or twice I have attempted it;--', 'but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced', 'you.\"', '\"Four months!--and yet you loved him!\"--', '\"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort', 'of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing', 'how much I felt.  Now, I can think and speak of it with', 'little emotion.  I would not have you suffer on my account;', 'for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself.', 'I have many things to support me.  I am not conscious of having', 'provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own,', 'I have borne it as much as possible without spreading', 'it farther.  I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.', 'I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always', 'doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret,', 'in the end he must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,', 'and that is the foundation on which every thing good may', 'be built.--And after all, Marianne, after all that is', 'bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment,', \"and all that can be said of one's happiness depending\", 'entirely on any particular person, it is not meant--it', 'is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.--', 'Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior', 'in person and understanding to half her sex; and time', 'and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought', 'another superior to HER.\"--', '\"If such is your way of thinking,\" said Marianne,', '\"if the loss of what is most valued is so easily', 'to be made up by something else, your resolution,', 'your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be', 'wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.\"', '\"I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever', 'felt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have had all this', 'hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak', 'of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make', 'you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained', 'to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.--', 'It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the', 'very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all', 'my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.--', \"This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose,\", 'by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most', 'deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have', 'had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.--', 'I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever,', 'without hearing one circumstance that could make me less', 'desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy;', 'nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.--', 'I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister,', 'and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the', 'punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.--', 'And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you', 'know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.--', 'If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you', 'may suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure', 'of mind with which I have brought myself at present', 'to consider the matter, the consolation that I have been', 'willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and', 'painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--', 'they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.--', 'No, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence,', 'perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I', 'owed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was', 'VERY unhappy.\"--', 'Marianne was quite subdued.--', '\"Oh!

But I am sorry to relate what ensued.', 'All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end', 'to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose', \"by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of\", 'no avail.  Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.', 'I never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before.', 'His mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case', 'of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on', 'him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings', 'in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters', 'grew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition', 'to this, if he still persisted in this low connection,', 'represented to him the certain penury that must attend', 'the match.  His own two thousand pounds she protested', 'should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far', 'would she be from affording him the smallest assistance,', 'that if he were to enter into any profession with a view', 'of better support, she would do all in her power to prevent', 'him advancing in it.\"', 'Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation,', 'clapped her hands together, and cried, \"Gracious God!', 'can this be possible!\"', '\"Well may you wonder, Marianne,\" replied her brother,', '\"at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these.', 'Your exclamation is very natural.\"', 'Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered', 'her promises, and forbore.', '\"All this, however,\" he continued, \"was urged in vain.', 'Edward said very little; but what he did say, was in', 'the most determined manner.  Nothing should prevail on', 'him to give up his engagement.  He would stand to it,', 'cost him what it might.\"', '\"Then,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity,', 'no longer able to be silent, \"he has acted like an honest', 'man! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had', 'done otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal.', 'I have some little concern in the business, as well', 'as yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe', 'there is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one', 'who more deserves a good husband.\"', 'John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature', 'was calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished', 'to offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune.', 'He therefore replied, without any resentment,', '\"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any', 'relation of yours, madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say,', 'a very deserving young woman, but in the present case', 'you know, the connection must be impossible.', 'And to have entered into a secret engagement with a', \"young man under her uncle's care, the son of a woman\", 'especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars,', 'is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short,', 'I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person', 'whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish', \"her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout\", 'the whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother,', 'in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has been dignified', 'and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear', 'it will be a bad one.\"', 'Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension;', \"and Elinor's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward,\", \"while braving his mother's threats, for a woman who could\", 'not reward him.', '\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did it end?\"', '\"I am sorry to say, ma\\'am, in a most unhappy rupture:--', \"Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother's notice.\", 'He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether', 'he is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can', 'make no inquiry.\"', '\"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"', '\"What, indeed, ma\\'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.', 'Born to the prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive', 'a situation more deplorable.  The interest of two thousand', 'pounds--how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added', 'the recollection, that he might, but for his own folly,', 'within three months have been in the receipt of two', 'thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has', 'thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself', 'a more wretched condition.  We must all feel for him;', 'and the more so, because it is totally out of our power', 'to assist him.\"', '\"Poor young man!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure', 'he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house;', 'and so I would tell him if I could see him.  It is not fit', 'that he should be living about at his own charge now,', 'at lodgings and taverns.\"', \"Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward,\", 'though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.', '\"If he would only have done as well by himself,\"', 'said John Dashwood, \"as all his friends were disposed to do', 'by him, he might now have been in his proper situation,', 'and would have wanted for nothing.  But as it is, it must', \"be out of anybody's power to assist him.  And there is one\", 'thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than', 'all--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind', 'of spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately,', \"which might have been Edward's, on proper conditions.\", 'I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over', 'the business.\"', '\"Well!\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"that is HER revenge.', \"Everybody has a way of their own.  But I don't think mine\", 'would be, to make one son independent, because another had', 'plagued me.\"', 'Marianne got up and walked about the room.', '\"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,\"', 'continued John, \"than to see his younger brother in', 'possession of an estate which might have been his own?', 'Poor Edward!  I feel for him sincerely.\"', 'A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion,', 'concluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his', 'sisters that he really believed there was no material', \"danger in Fanny's indisposition, and that they need\", 'not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;', 'leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments', 'on the present occasion, as far at least as it regarded', \"Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the Dashwoods', and Edward's.\", \"Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he\", 'quitted the room; and as her vehemence made reserve', 'impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings,', 'they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party.', 'CHAPTER 38', \"Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's\", 'conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its', 'true merit.  THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt', 'him to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation,', 'beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could', 'remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.', 'Elinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all', 'his offences in compassion for his punishment.  But though', 'confidence between them was, by this public discovery,', 'restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on', 'which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.', 'Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still', 'more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive', \"assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued\", 'affection for herself which she rather wished to do away;', \"and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying\", 'to converse upon a topic which always left her more', 'dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison', \"it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.\", 'She felt all the force of that comparison; but not', 'as her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now;', 'she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach,', 'regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted', 'herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,', 'without the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened', 'that she still fancied present exertion impossible,', 'and therefore it only dispirited her more.', 'Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards,', \"of affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings.\", 'But though so much of the matter was known to them already,', 'that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading', 'that knowledge farther, without seeking after more,', 'she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort', 'and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could;', 'and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual,', 'had prevented her going to them within that time.', 'The third day succeeding their knowledge of the', 'particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw', 'many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second', 'week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number;', 'but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again', 'in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them,', 'chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public', 'a place.', 'An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined', 'them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was', 'not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging', \"all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was herself left\", 'to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,', 'nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody', 'who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting', 'to her.  But at last she found herself with some surprise,', 'accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy,', 'expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving', 'encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings,', \"left her own party for a short time, to join their's.\", 'Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,', '\"Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you', 'any thing if you ask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.\"', \"It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity\", \"and Elinor's too, that she would tell any thing WITHOUT\", 'being asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt.', '\"I am so glad to meet you;\" said Miss Steele,', 'taking her familiarly by the arm--\"for I wanted to see you', 'of all things in the world.\"  And then lowering her voice,', '\"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it.', 'Is she angry?\"', '\"Not at all, I believe, with you.\"', '\"That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?\"', '\"I cannot suppose it possible that she should.\"', '\"I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have', 'had such a time of it!

She vowed at first she would never trim me', 'up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again,', 'so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to,', 'and we are as good friends as ever.  Look, she made me', 'this bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night.', 'There now, YOU are going to laugh at me too.  But why', 'should not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it IS', \"the Doctor's favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part,\", 'I should never have known he DID like it better than', 'any other colour, if he had not happened to say so.', 'My cousins have been so plaguing me!

Whatever Lucy might think', 'about it herself, you know, it was no business of other', 'people to set it down for certain.\"', '\"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before,', 'I assure you,\" said Elinor.', '\"Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well,', 'and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks,', 'that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars', 'to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand', 'pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had', 'nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.', 'And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself,', 'that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars', 'would be off; and when Edward did not come near us', 'for three days, I could not tell what to think myself;', 'and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost;', \"for we came away from your brother's Wednesday,\", 'and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday,', 'and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.', 'Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits', 'rose against that.  However this morning he came just', 'as we came home from church; and then it all came out,', 'how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,', 'and been talked to by his mother and all of them,', 'and how he had declared before them all that he loved', 'nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have.', 'And how he had been so worried by what passed,', \"that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house,\", 'he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country,', 'some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn', 'all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better', 'of it.  And after thinking it all over and over again,', 'he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,', 'and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep', 'her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss,', 'for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope', 'of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders,', 'as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy,', 'and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear', 'to think of her doing no better, and so he begged,', 'if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the', 'matter directly, and leave him shift for himself.', 'I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.', 'And it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account,', 'that he said a word about being off, and not upon his own.', 'I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being', 'tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any', 'thing like it.  But, to be sure, Lucy would not give', 'ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly', '(with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,', \"and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things\", 'you know)--she told him directly, she had not the least', 'mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him', 'upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have,', 'she should be very glad to have it all, you know,', 'or something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy,', 'and talked on some time about what they should do,', 'and they agreed he should take orders directly,', 'and they must wait to be married till he got a living.', 'And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin', 'called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in', 'her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens;', 'so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them,', 'to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not', 'care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put', 'on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.\"', '\"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\"', 'said Elinor; \"you were all in the same room together,', 'were not you?\"', '\"No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you', 'think people make love when any body else is by?  Oh,', 'for shame!--To be sure you must know better than that.', '(Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in the', 'drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening', 'at the door.\"', '\"How!\" cried Elinor; \"have you been repeating to me', 'what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?', 'I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly', 'would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a', 'conversation which you ought not to have known yourself.', 'How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?\"', '\"Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stood at', 'the door, and heard what I could.  And I am sure Lucy would', 'have done just the same by me; for a year or two back,', 'when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together,', 'she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind', 'a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.\"', 'Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss', 'Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes,', 'from what was uppermost in her mind.', '\"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,\" said she;', '\"but now he is lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.  What an', \"ill-natured woman his mother is, an't she? And your\", 'brother and sister were not very kind! However,', \"I shan't say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure\", 'they did send us home in their own chariot, which', 'was more than I looked for.  And for my part, I was all', 'in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the', 'huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,', 'nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine', 'out of sight.  Edward have got some business at Oxford,', 'he says; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT,', 'as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained.', 'I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!', \"(giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know what\", 'my cousins will say, when they hear of it.  They will', 'tell me I should write to the Doctor, to get Edward', 'the curacy of his new living.  I know they will; but I am', 'sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.--', \"'La!' I shall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think\", 'of such a thing?  I write to the Doctor, indeed!\\'\"', '\"Well,\" said Elinor, \"it is a comfort to be prepared', 'against the worst.  You have got your answer ready.\"', 'Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject,', 'but the approach of her own party made another more necessary.', '\"Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.

I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about', 'it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she', 'is not in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same;', 'and if anything should happen to take you and your', 'sister away, and Mrs. Jennings should want company,', 'I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her', 'for as long a time as she likes.

Edward's marriage\", 'with Lucy was as firmly determined on, and the time', 'of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain,', 'as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,', 'exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment,', 'of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.', 'As soon as they returned to the carriage,', 'Mrs. Jennings was eager for information; but as Elinor', 'wished to spread as little as possible intelligence', 'that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,', 'she confined herself to the brief repetition of such', 'simple particulars, as she felt assured that Lucy,', 'for the sake of her own consequence, would choose', 'to have known.  The continuance of their engagement,', 'and the means that were able to be taken for promoting', 'its end, was all her communication; and this produced', 'from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark.', '\"Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how', 'THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding', 'no good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty', 'pounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds,', 'and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can', 'give her.--Then they will have a child every year! and', \"Lord help 'em! how poor they will be!--I must see\", 'what I can give them towards furnishing their house.', \"Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I talked of t'other\", 'day.--No, no, they must get a stout girl of all works.--', 'Betty\\'s sister would never do for them NOW.\"', 'The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the', 'two-penny post from Lucy herself.

Elinor was hardly', 'less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much', 'less bent on its being effected immediately, as that she', 'was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey,', 'which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge.', 'She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards', 'its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes', 'to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the', 'eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,', 'which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks', 'longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible', 'than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland', 'about the end of March, for the Easter holidays;', 'and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very', 'warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them.  This would', 'not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of', 'Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real', 'politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very', 'great amendment of his manners towards them since her', 'sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept', 'it with pleasure.', 'When she told Marianne what she had done, however,', 'her first reply was not very auspicious.', '\"Cleveland!\"--she cried, with great agitation.', '\"No, I cannot go to Cleveland.\"--', '\"You forget,\" said Elinor gently, \"that its situation', 'is not...that it is not in the neighbourhood of...\"', '\"But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go', 'into Somersetshire.--There, where I looked forward', 'to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there.\"', 'Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming', 'such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by', 'working on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure', 'which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother,', 'whom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible,', 'more comfortable manner, than any other plan could do,', 'and perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland,', 'which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to', \"Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey;\", \"and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend\", 'them down; and as there could be no occasion of their', 'staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at', \"home in little more than three weeks' time.  As Marianne's\", 'affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph', 'with little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.', 'Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest,', 'that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again', 'from Cleveland.

Will you', 'be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford,', \"now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post,\", 'is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,', 'perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now,', 'it may be  nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it', 'were more  valuable.-- It is a rectory, but a small one;', 'the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than', '200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable', 'of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as', 'to afford him a very comfortable income.  Such as it is,', 'however, my pleasure in presenting him to it,', 'will be very great.  Pray assure him of it.\"', \"Elinor's astonishment at this commission could\", 'hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really', 'making her an offer of his hand.  The preferment,', 'which only two days before she had considered as hopeless', 'for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--', 'and SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to', 'bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had', 'attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor', 'feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share', 'in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,', 'and her gratitude for the particular friendship,', 'which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act,', 'were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.  She thanked him', \"for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and\", 'disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve;', 'and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure,', 'if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office', 'to another.  But at the same time, she could not help', 'thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself.', 'It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give', 'Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER,', 'she would have been very glad to be spared herself;--', 'but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy,', 'declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being', 'given through her means, that she would not on any account', 'make farther opposition.  Edward, she believed, was still in', 'town,', 'and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele.', 'She could undertake therefore to inform him of it,', 'in the course of the day.  After this had been settled,', 'Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage', 'in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour,', 'and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the', 'house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor,', 'as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very light of,', 'at least as far as regarded its size.', '\"The smallness of the house,\" said she,', '\"I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them,', 'for it will be in proportion to their family and income.\"', 'By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE', \"was considering Mr. Ferrars's marriage as the certain\", 'consequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it', 'possible that Delaford living could supply such an income,', 'as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on--', 'and he said so.', '\"This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars', 'comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.', 'I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this;', 'and my interest is hardly more extensive.  If, however,', 'by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve', 'him farther, I must think very differently of him', 'from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful', 'to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present.', 'What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,', 'since it can advance him so little towards what must', 'be his principal, his only object of happiness.', 'His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least,', 'I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--\"', 'Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood,', 'so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings;', 'but after this narration of what really passed between', 'Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at the window,', 'the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may', 'perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,', 'nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from', 'an offer of marriage.', 'CHAPTER 40', '\"Well, Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Jennings,', 'sagaciously smiling, as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn,', '\"I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you;', 'for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of hearing,', 'I could not help catching enough to understand his business.', 'And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,', 'and I wish you joy of it with all my heart.\"', '\"Thank you, ma\\'am,\" said Elinor.  \"It is a matter', 'of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel', 'Brandon most sensibly.  There are not many men who would', 'act as he has done.  Few people who have so compassionate', 'a heart!  I never was more astonished in my life.\"', '\"Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I an\\'t the least', 'astonished at it in the world, for I have often thought', 'of late, there was nothing more likely to happen.\"', '\"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel\\'s', 'general benevolence; but at least you could not foresee', 'that the opportunity would so very soon occur.\"', '\"Opportunity!\" repeated Mrs. Jennings--\"Oh! as to that,', 'when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing,', 'somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity.', 'Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and again;', 'and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think', 'I shall soon know where to look for them.\"', '\"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,\"', 'said Elinor, with a faint smile.', '\"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  And as to the house', 'being a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel would be at,', 'for it is as good a one as ever I saw.\"', '\"He spoke of its being out of repair.\"', '\"Well, and whose fault is that? why don\\'t he repair it?--', 'who should do it but himself?\"', \"They were interrupted by the servant's coming in to\", 'announce the carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings', 'immediately preparing to go, said,--', '\"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half', 'my talk out.  But, however, we may have it all over in', 'the evening; for we shall be quite alone.  I do not ask', 'you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too full', 'of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must', 'long to tell your sister all about it.\"', 'Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.', '\"Certainly, ma\\'am, I shall tell Marianne of it;', 'but I shall not mention it at present to any body else.\"', '\"Oh! very well,\" said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed.', '\"Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think', 'of going as far as Holborn to-day.\"', '\"No, ma\\'am, not even Lucy if you please.', \"One day's delay will not be very material; and till I\", 'have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought not to be', 'mentioned to any body else.  I shall do THAT directly.', 'It is of importance that no time should be lost with him,', 'for he will of course have much to do relative to', 'his ordination.\"', 'This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly.', 'Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it', 'in such a hurry, she could not immediately comprehend.', \"A few moments' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea,\", 'and she exclaimed;--', '\"Oh, ho!--I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be', 'the man.  Well, so much the better for him.  Ay, to be sure,', 'he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad', 'to find things are so forward between you.  But, my dear,', 'is not this rather out of character?  Should not the Colonel', 'write himself?--sure, he is the proper person.\"', 'Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of', \"Mrs. Jennings's speech, neither did she think it worth\", 'inquiring into; and therefore only replied to its conclusion.', '\"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather', 'wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars', 'than himself.\"', '\"And so YOU are forced to do it.

However, you will think of all', 'that at your leisure.\"', '\"Certainly, ma\\'am,\" replied Elinor, not hearing', 'much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone,', 'than to be mistress of the subject.', 'How she should begin--how she should express', 'herself in her note to Edward, was now all her concern.', 'The particular circumstances between them made', 'a difficulty of that which to any other person would', 'have been the easiest thing in the world; but she', 'equally feared to say too much or too little, and sat', 'deliberating over her paper, with the pen in her band,', 'till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.', 'He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to', 'the carriage, as he came to leave his farewell card; and she,', 'after apologising for not returning herself, had obliged', 'him to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above,', 'and wanted to speak with him on very particular business.', 'Elinor had just been congratulating herself,', 'in the midst of her perplexity, that however difficult it', 'might be to express herself properly by letter, it was', 'at least preferable to giving the information by word', 'of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her upon this', 'greatest exertion of all.  Her astonishment and confusion', 'were very great on his so sudden appearance.  She had', 'not seen him before since his engagement became public,', 'and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted', 'with it; which, with the consciousness of what she', 'had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him,', 'made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.', 'He too was much distressed; and they sat down together', 'in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he', 'had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming', 'into the room, he could not recollect; but determining', 'to be on the safe side, he made his apology in form', 'as soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair.', '\"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished', 'to speak with me, at least I understood her so--or I', 'certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner;', 'though at the same time, I should have been extremely', 'sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;', 'especially as it will most likely be some time--it', 'is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure', 'of meeting you again.

Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said.', 'I have something of consequence to inform you of,', 'which I was on the point of communicating by paper.', 'I am charged with a most agreeable office (breathing', 'rather faster than usual as she spoke.)

As a friend of mine,', 'of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he HAS,', 'still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word,', 'you owe nothing to my solicitation.\"', 'Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share', 'in the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling', 'to appear as the benefactress of Edward, that she acknowledged', 'it with hesitation; which probably contributed to fix', 'that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it.', 'For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had ceased', 'to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,', '\"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.', 'I have always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother', 'I know esteems him highly.

Elinor, however little concerned', 'in it, joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had', 'the knack of finding her way in every house to the library,', 'however it might be avoided by the family in general,', 'soon procured herself a book.', \"Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that constant\", 'and friendly good humour could do, to make them feel', 'themselves welcome.  The openness and heartiness of her', 'manner more than atoned for that want of recollection', 'and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms', 'of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty', 'a face, was engaging; her folly, though evident', 'was not disgusting, because it was not conceited;', 'and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.', 'The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very', 'late dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party,', 'and a very welcome variety to their conversation, which a', 'long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low.', 'Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that', 'little had seen so much variety in his address to her', 'sister and herself, that she knew not what to expect', 'to find him in his own family.

For the rest of his character and habits,', 'they were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive,', 'with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life.', 'He was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours;', 'fond of his child, though affecting to slight it;', 'and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought', 'to have been devoted to business.  She liked him, however,', 'upon the whole, much better than she had expected, and in', 'her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;--', 'not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism,', 'his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with complacency', \"on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple taste,\", 'and diffident feelings.', 'Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns,', 'she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon,', 'who had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who,', 'treating her at once as the disinterested friend', 'of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself,', 'talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford,', 'described its deficiencies, and told her what he meant', 'to do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour', 'to her in this, as well as in every other particular,', 'his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence', 'of only ten days, his readiness to converse with her,', 'and his deference for her opinion, might very well', \"justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment,\", 'and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still,', 'as from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite,', 'to make her suspect it herself.

Though heavy and feverish, with a pain', \"in her limbs, and a cough, and a sore throat, a good night's\", 'rest was to cure her entirely; and it was with difficulty', 'that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went to bed,', 'to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.', 'CHAPTER 43', 'Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time;', 'to every inquiry replied that she was better, and tried to', 'prove herself so, by engaging in her accustomary employments.', 'But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire', 'with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read,', 'or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak', 'much in favour of her amendment; and when, at last,', 'she went early to bed, more and more indisposed, Colonel', \"Brandon was only astonished at her sister's composure,\", 'who, though attending and nursing her the whole day,', 'against Marianne inclination, and forcing proper medicines', 'on her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty', 'and efficacy of sleep, and felt no real alarm.', 'A very restless and feverish night, however,', 'disappointed the expectation of both; and when Marianne,', 'after persisting in rising, confessed herself unable', 'to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her bed,', \"Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice,\", \"of sending for the Palmers' apothecary.\", 'He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging', 'Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore', 'her sister to health, yet, by pronouncing her disorder', 'to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the word \"infection\"', 'to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,', \"on her baby's account.  Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined\", \"from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious\", \"than Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report,\", \"and confirming Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the\", 'necessity of her immediate removal with her infant;', 'and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle,', 'found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great', 'to be withstood.  Her departure, therefore, was fixed on;', \"and within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off,\", 'with her little boy and his nurse, for the house of a', \"near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a few miles\", 'on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised,', 'at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two;', 'and whither she was almost equally urgent with her', 'mother to accompany her.  Mrs. Jennings, however, with a', 'kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,', 'declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland', 'as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,', 'by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place', 'of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her', 'on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,', 'desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her', 'better experience in nursing, of material use.', 'Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature', 'of her malady, and feeling herself universally ill,', 'could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered;', 'and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced,', 'but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe;', 'for on that day they were to have begun their journey home;', 'and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings,', 'were to have taken their mother by surprise on the', 'following forenoon.  The little she said was all in', 'lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried', 'to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN', 'really believed herself, that it would be a very short one.', 'The next day produced little or no alteration in the', 'state of the patient; she certainly was not better, and,', 'except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse.', 'Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer,', 'though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity', 'and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be', 'frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last', 'by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her;', 'and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself,', 'with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going', 'likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings', 'interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away', \"while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's\", 'account, would be to deprive them both, she thought,', 'of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once', 'that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself,', 'that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening,', 'while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &c. she', 'urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying', 'the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not', \"long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's\", 'entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed', 'to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person', 'so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.', 'Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all', 'these arrangements.  She knew not that she had been', 'the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away,', 'in about seven days from the time of their arrival.', 'It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing', 'of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern,', 'she never mentioned her name.', \"Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure,\", 'and her situation continued, with little variation,', 'the same.  Mr. Harris, who attended her every day,', 'still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood', 'was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others', 'was by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined', 'very early in the seizure that Marianne would never', 'get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly', \"of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's forebodings,\", 'was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.', 'He tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different', 'judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd;', 'but the many hours of each day in which he was left', 'entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission', 'of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from', 'his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.', 'On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy', 'anticipations of both were almost done away; for when', 'Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better.', 'Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable', 'than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed in every', 'pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that', 'in her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own', \"judgment rather than her friend's, in making very light\", 'of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland;', 'and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be', 'able to travel.', 'But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.--', 'Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing', 'more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before.', 'Her sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to', 'attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue', 'of having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully', 'administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with', 'satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which', 'she expected the most beneficial effects.  Her sleep,', 'though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it,', 'lasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe', 'the result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her', 'during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing', 'of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed;', 'her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating', \"herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained\", 'alone with Marianne.', 'The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed;', 'and her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention', 'her continual change of posture, and heard the frequent', 'but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips,', 'was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber,', 'when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise', 'in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness,', 'cried out,--', '\"Is mama coming?--\"', '\"Not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror,', 'and assisting Marianne to lie down again, \"but she will', 'be here, I hope, before it is long.  It is a great way,', 'you know, from hence to Barton.\"', '\"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne,', 'in the same hurried manner.  \"I shall never see her,', 'if she goes by London.\"', 'Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not', 'quite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her,', 'eagerly felt her pulse.  It was lower and quicker than ever!', 'and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm', 'increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending', 'instantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger', 'to Barton for her mother.  To consult with Colonel Brandon', 'on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought', 'which immediately followed the resolution of its performance;', 'and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place', 'by her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room,', 'where she knew he was generally to be found at a much', 'later hour than the present.', 'It was no time for hesitation.  Her fears and her', 'difficulties were immediately before him.  Her fears,', 'he had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--', 'he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her', 'difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness', 'that seemed to speak the occasion, and the service', 'pre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the', 'messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.  Elinor made no', 'resistance that was not easily overcome.  She thanked him', 'with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went', 'to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and', 'an order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines', 'to her mother.', 'The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel', 'Brandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully', 'was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,', 'whose attendance must relieve, and whose friendship might', 'soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD', 'be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,', 'would lessen it.', 'HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all', 'the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary', 'arrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated', 'with exactness the time in which she might look for', 'his return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.', 'The horses arrived, even before they were expected,', 'and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look', 'of solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear,', 'hurried into the carriage.  It was then about twelve', \"o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait\", 'for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her', 'the rest of the night.  It was a night of almost equal', 'suffering to both.  Hour after hour passed away in sleepless', \"pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most\", \"cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared.\", 'Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all', 'her former security; and the servant who sat up with her,', 'for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called,', 'only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress', 'had always thought.', \"Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals,\", 'fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she', 'mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of', 'poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled', 'with so many days of illness, and wretched for some', 'immediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon', 'be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long,', 'and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving', 'too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.', 'She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris,', 'or if HE could not come, for some other advice,', \"when the former--but not till after five o'clock--arrived.\", 'His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay,', 'for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant', 'alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger', 'to be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh', 'mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which,', 'in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor.  He promised', 'to call again in the course of three or four hours,', 'and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more', 'composed than he had found them.', 'With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not', 'being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the', 'morning of what had passed.  Her former apprehensions,', 'now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of', 'the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,', \"her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her\", 'to offer the comfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.', 'The rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young,', 'so lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested', \"person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings's compassion\", 'she had other claims.  She had been for three months', 'her companion, was still under her care, and she was', 'known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy.', 'The distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite,', 'was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings', 'considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what', 'Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings', 'was very sincere.', 'Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--', 'but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the', 'last would produce.  His medicines had failed;--the fever', 'was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet--not more', 'herself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching all,', 'and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call', 'in further advice.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had', 'still something more to try, some more fresh application,', 'of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his', 'visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached', 'the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood.', 'She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;', 'but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued', \"till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed,\", 'her thoughts wandering from one image of grief,', 'one suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed', 'to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,', 'who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger', 'of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition', \"which Marianne's disappointment had brought on.\", 'Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it', 'gave fresh misery to her reflections.', 'About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a', 'dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent,', 'even to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive', \"a slight amendment in her sister's pulse;--she waited,\", 'watched, and examined it again and again;--and at last,', 'with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness,', 'than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate', 'her hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,', 'to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her', 'young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--', 'and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust,', 'told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was too late.', 'Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter,', 'she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.', 'Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom', 'yet blessed her.  Others even arose to confirm it.', 'Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor', 'with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on', 'her with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and', 'hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no', 'moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at', \"four o'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on\", 'a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation,', 'gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.', 'Marianne was in every respect materially better,', 'and he declared her entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings,', 'perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her', 'forebodings which had been found in their late alarm,', 'allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,', 'with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness,', 'the probability of an entire recovery.', 'Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a', 'different kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety.', 'Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her', 'doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations', 'of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--', 'but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,', \"no smiles.  All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction,\", 'silent and strong.', 'She continued by the side of her sister, with little', 'intermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear,', 'satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits,', 'supplying every succour, and watching almost every look and', 'every breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,', 'in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--', 'but when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination,', 'that every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne', \"at six o'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all\", 'appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.', 'The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon', \"might be expected back.  At ten o'clock, she trusted,\", 'or at least not much later her mother would be relieved', 'from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be', 'travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely', 'less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress', 'of time which yet kept them in ignorance!', \"At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep,\", 'she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.', 'Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of', 'dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--', 'and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings', 'of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.', 'Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion,', \"to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to\", 'take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue,', 'no capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was', 'not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant.', 'Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the', 'sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,', 'left her there again to her charge and her thoughts,', 'and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.', 'The night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared', 'round the house, and the rain beat against the windows;', 'but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.', 'Marianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--', 'they had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience.', 'The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten,', 'Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment', 'she heard a carriage driving up to the house;', 'and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite', 'of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,', 'that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and', 'opened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth.', 'She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her.', 'The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.', 'By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it', 'to be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the', \"excess of her poor mother's alarm, gave some explanation\", 'to such unexpected rapidity.', 'Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult', 'to be calm, as at that moment.  The knowledge of what her', 'mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--', 'of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and', 'of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was', 'impossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done', 'was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till', \"she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with her sister,\", 'she hurried down stairs.', 'The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along', 'an inner lobby, assured her that they were already', 'in the house.  She rushed to the drawing-room,--she', 'entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.', 'CHAPTER 44', 'Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at', 'the sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart', 'in turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand', 'was already on the lock, when its action was suspended', 'by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather', 'of command than supplication,', '\"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--', 'I entreat you to stay.\"', '\"No, sir,\" she replied with firmness, \"I shall NOT stay.', 'Your business cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose,', 'forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"', '\"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence,', '\"that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil,', 'it would not have turned me from the door.  My business', 'is with you, and only you.\"', '\"With me!\"--in the utmost amazement--\"well, sir,--', 'be quick--and if you can--less violent.\"', '\"Sit down, and I will be both.\"', 'She hesitated; she knew not what to do.  The possibility', \"of Colonel Brandon's arriving and finding her there,\", 'came across her.  But she had promised to hear him,', 'and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged.', \"After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that\", 'prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would', 'best promote it, she walked silently towards the table,', 'and sat down.  He took the opposite chair, and for half', 'a minute not a word was said by either.', '\"Pray be quick, sir,\"--said Elinor, impatiently;--', '\"I have no time to spare.\"', 'He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation,', 'and seemed not to hear her.', '\"Your sister,\" said he, with abruptness, a moment', 'afterwards--\"is out of danger.

But at first', 'I must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.', 'Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement,', 'giving way to feelings which I had always been too much', 'in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means', 'in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any', 'design of returning her affection.\"', 'Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him', 'with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,', '\"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby,', 'for you to relate, or for me to listen any longer.', 'Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.--', 'Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on', 'the subject.\"', '\"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied,', '\"My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive,', 'always in the habit of associating with people of better', 'income than myself.  Every year since my coming of age,', 'or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though', 'the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free;', 'yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant,', 'it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my', 'circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune.  To attach', 'myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be', 'thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty--', 'which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,', 'Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting', 'in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a', 'thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said', 'for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity,', 'I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated,', 'because I did not THEN know what it was to love.', 'But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted; for, had I', 'really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity,', 'to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?--', 'But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,', 'which her affection and her society would have deprived', 'of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,', 'lost every thing that could make it a blessing.\"', '\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened,', '\"believe yourself at one time attached to her?\"', '\"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood', 'such tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have', 'done it?--Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees,', 'sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life', 'were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions', 'were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.', 'Even THEN, however, when fully determined on paying', 'my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly', 'to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,', 'from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement', 'while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.', 'I will not reason here--nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate', 'on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling', 'to engage my faith where my honour was already bound.', 'The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,', 'providing with great circumspection for a possible', 'opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched', 'for ever.  At last, however, my resolution was taken,', 'and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,', 'to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her,', 'and openly assure her of an affection which I had already', 'taken such pains to display.  But in the interim--in the', 'interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I', 'could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private--', 'a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin', 'all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery', 'took place,\"--here he hesitated and looked down.--\"Mrs. Smith', 'had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some', 'distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of', 'her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not', 'explain myself farther,\" he added, looking at her with an', 'heightened colour and an enquiring eye--\"your particular', 'intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago.\"', '\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise,', 'and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him,', '\"I have heard it all.  And how you will explain away any', 'part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess', 'is beyond my comprehension.\"', '\"Remember,\" cried Willoughby, \"from whom you received', 'the account.  Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge', 'that her situation and her character ought to have been', 'respected by me.  I do not mean to justify myself, but at', 'the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing', 'to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,', 'and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.', 'If the violence of her passions, the weakness of her', 'understanding--I do not mean, however, to defend myself.', 'Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often,', 'with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which,', 'for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.', 'I wish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured', 'more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection', 'for me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers;', 'and whose mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!\"--', '\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate', 'girl--I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion', 'of such a subject may well be--your indifference is no', 'apology for your cruel neglect of her.  Do not think yourself', 'excused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding', 'on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.', 'You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself', 'in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay,', 'always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence.\"', '\"But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,\" he warmly', 'replied; \"I did not recollect that I had omitted to give', 'her my direction; and common sense might have told her', 'how to find it out.\"', '\"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\"', '\"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion', 'may be guessed.  The purity of her life, the formality', 'of her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing', 'was against me.  The matter itself I could not deny,', 'and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was', 'previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my', 'conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with', 'the very little attention, the very little portion of my', 'time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit.', 'In short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I', 'might have saved myself.  In the height of her morality,', 'good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would', 'marry Eliza.  That could not be--and I was formally', 'dismissed from her favour and her house.  The night', 'following this affair--I was to go the next morning--', 'was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct', 'should be.  The struggle was great--but it ended too soon.', 'My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her', 'attachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh', 'that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false', 'ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally', 'inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased.', 'I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife,', 'if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think', 'that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do.', 'A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave', 'Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day;', 'some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking', 'this engagement.  But whether I should write this apology,', 'or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate.', 'To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted', 'whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution.', 'In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,', 'as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw', 'her miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping', 'never to see her again.\"', '\"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\" said Elinor,', 'reproachfully; \"a note would have answered every purpose.--', 'Why was it necessary to call?\"', '\"It was necessary to my own pride.  I could not bear', 'to leave the country in a manner that might lead you,', 'or the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part', 'of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself--', 'and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage,', 'in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister,', 'however, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter,', 'I found her alone.  You were all gone I do not know where.', 'I had left her only the evening before, so fully,', 'so firmly resolved within my self on doing right!', 'A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever;', 'and I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I', 'walked from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself,', 'delighted with every body!  But in this, our last interview', 'of friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt', 'that almost took from me the power of dissembling.', 'Her sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told', 'her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I', 'never shall forget it--united too with such reliance,', 'such confidence in me!--Oh, God!--what a hard-hearted', 'rascal I was!\"', 'They were both silent for a few moments.', 'Elinor first spoke.', '\"Did you tell her that you should soon return?\"', '\"I do not know what I told her,\" he replied, impatiently;', '\"less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all', 'likelihood much more than was justified by the future.', \"I cannot think of it.--It won't do.--Then came your dear mother\", 'to torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence.', 'Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I was miserable.', 'Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it', 'gives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge', 'to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart,', 'that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and', 'exultation to me now.  Well, I went, left all that I loved,', 'and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent.', 'My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,', 'and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my', 'own reflections so cheerful--when I looked forward', 'every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton,', 'the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed journey!\"', 'He stopped.', '\"Well, sir,\" said Elinor, who, though pitying him,', 'grew impatient for his departure, \"and this is all?\"', '\"Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?--', 'That infamous letter--Did she shew it you?\"', '\"Yes, I saw every note that passed.\"', '\"When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did,', 'for I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is--', 'in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more', 'simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--', 'my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word', 'was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer,', 'were she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart.', 'To know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--', 'a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof', 'would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe', 'they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure', 'they are dearer.\"', \"Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes\", 'in the course of this extraordinary conversation,', 'was now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check', 'such ideas in her companion as the last.', '\"This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that', 'you are married.  Relate only what in your conscience', 'you think necessary for me to hear.\"', '\"Marianne\\'s note, by assuring me that I was still', 'as dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many,', 'many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant', 'in her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy', 'of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say awakened,', 'because time and London, business and dissipation,', 'had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing', 'a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her,', 'and chusing to fancy that she too must have become', 'indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment', 'as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders', 'in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,', 'overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then,', \"'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.'--\", 'But this note made me know myself better.  I felt that', 'she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman', 'in the world, and that I was using her infamously.', 'But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey', 'and me.  To retreat was impossible.  All that I had to do,', 'was to avoid you both.  I sent no answer to Marianne,', 'intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice;', 'and for some time I was even determined not to call in', 'Berkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect', 'the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else,', 'I watched you all safely out of the house one morning,', 'and left my name.\"', '\"Watched us out of the house!\"', '\"Even so.  You would be surprised to hear how often', 'I watched you, how often I was on the point of falling', 'in with you.  I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight,', 'as the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I did in Bond Street,', 'there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse', 'of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant', 'watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing', 'desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us', 'so long.  I avoided the Middletons as much as possible,', 'as well as everybody else who was likely to prove', 'an acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being', 'in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe,', 'the first day of his coming, and the day after I had called', \"at Mrs. Jennings's.  He asked me to a party, a dance at his\", 'house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement', 'that you and your sister were to be there, I should have', 'felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.', 'The next morning brought another short note from Marianne--', 'still affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything', 'that could make MY conduct most hateful.  I could not', 'answer it.  I tried--but could not frame a sentence.', 'But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.', 'If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it', 'was THEN.  With my head and heart full of your sister,', 'I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those', 'three or four weeks were worse than all.  Well, at last,', 'as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a', 'sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!--', 'Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me', 'Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand', 'to me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching', 'eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and', 'Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other hand, looking', 'all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is over now.--', 'Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;', \"but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white\", 'as death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--', 'the last manner in which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid', 'sight!--yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying,', 'it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew', 'exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last', 'in this world.  She was before me, constantly before me,', 'as I travelled, in the same look and hue.\"', 'A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.', 'Willoughby first rousing himself, broke it thus:', '\"Well, let me make haste and be gone.  Your sister', 'is certainly better, certainly out of danger?\"', '\"We are assured of it.\"', '\"Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne.\"', '\"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter;', 'have you any thing to say about that?\"', '\"Yes, yes, THAT in particular.  Your sister', 'wrote to me again, you know, the very next morning.', 'You saw what she said.  I was breakfasting at the', 'Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought', 'to me there from my lodgings.  It happened to catch', \"Sophia's eye before it caught mine--and its size,\", 'the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether,', 'immediately gave her a suspicion.  Some vague report had', 'reached her before of my attachment to some young lady', 'in Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation', 'the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was,', 'and made her more jealous than ever.  Affecting that air', 'of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman', 'one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read', 'its contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.', 'She read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness I could', 'have borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it', 'must be appeased.  And, in short--what do you think of my', \"wife's style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--\", 'truly feminine--was it not?\"', '\"Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing.\"', '\"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying', 'such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to.', 'The original was all her own--her own happy thoughts', 'and gentle diction.  But what could I do!--we were engaged,', 'every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am', 'talking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words,', 'her money was necessary to me, and in a situation like', 'mine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture.', 'And after all, what did it signify to my character', 'in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language', 'my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.', 'My business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether', 'I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.--', \"'I am ruined for ever in their opinion--' said I to\", \"myself--'I am shut out for ever from their society,\", 'they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter', \"will only make them think me a blackguard one.' Such were\", 'my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness,', \"I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics\", 'of Marianne.  Her three notes--unluckily they were all', 'in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence,', 'and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up,', 'and could not even kiss them.

Now, however, his good-natured, honest,', 'stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern', 'for your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling', 'me what he knew ought to--though probably he did not', 'think it WOULD--vex me horridly.

The world had made him', 'extravagant and vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him', 'cold-hearted and selfish.  Vanity, while seeking its own', 'guilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved', 'him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least', 'its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.', 'Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led', 'him likewise to punishment.  The attachment, from which', 'against honour, against feeling, against every better interest', 'he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no longer allowable,', 'governed every thought; and the connection, for the sake', 'of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister', 'to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness', 'to himself of a far more incurable nature.  From a reverie', 'of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes', 'by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie at least', 'equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said--', '\"There is no use in staying here; I must be off.\"', '\"Are you going back to town?\"', '\"No--to Combe Magna.  I have business there;', 'from thence to town in a day or two.  Good bye.\"', 'He held out his hand.

She felt that his influence over her mind', 'was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason', 'to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,', 'that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it', 'was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love', 'for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.', 'But she felt that it was so, long, long before she could', 'feel his influence less.', 'When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne,', 'she found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet', \"a sleep to the extent of her hopes.  Elinor's heart was full.\", \"The past, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit,\", \"Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected arrival,\", 'threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits', 'which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made', 'her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister.', 'Short was the time, however, in which that fear could', \"affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's\", 'leaving the house, she was again called down stairs', 'by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her', \"mother from every unnecessary moment's horrible suspense,\", 'she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward', 'door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it.', 'Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the', \"house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's\", 'being no more, had no voice to inquire after her,', 'no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither for', 'salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--', 'and her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth,', 'was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she', 'had been before by her fears.  She was supported into', 'the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;--', 'and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable', 'to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her', \"at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look\", 'which spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction', 'of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment.', 'He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her own.', 'As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself,', 'to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she', 'was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever', \"by absence, unhappiness, and danger.  Elinor's delight,\", 'as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked', 'by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;--', 'but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent,', 'when the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne,', 'satisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious', 'of being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the', 'silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her.', 'Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor,', \"in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed.\", 'But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless,', 'and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to', 'make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits.', 'Willoughby, \"poor Willoughby,\" as she now allowed', 'herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she', 'would not but have heard his vindication for the world,', 'and now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him', 'so harshly before.  But her promise of relating it to her', 'sister was invariably painful.  She dreaded the performance', 'of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be;', 'doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever', 'be happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby', 'a widower.  Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself,', 'felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more', \"than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was due,\", \"and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby's death.\", \"The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been\", 'much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm;', 'for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she', 'had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that', 'very day, without waiting for any further intelligence,', 'and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,', 'that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch', 'Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her', 'where there might be infection.', 'Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant', \"cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved\", 'her to be, as she repeatedly declared herself, one of', 'the happiest women in the world.  Elinor could not hear', 'the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes', 'wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.', 'But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account', 'of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her,', 'was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only', 'of what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to her', 'from a danger in which, as she now began to feel,', 'her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate', 'attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;--', 'and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy', 'unthought of by Elinor.

But his coming', 'for me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship,', 'is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.\"', '\"His character, however,\" answered Elinor, \"does not rest', 'on ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne,', 'were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.', 'To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long', 'and intimately known; they equally love and respect him;', 'and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired,', 'is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him,', 'that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready', 'as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing', 'to us in the world.

There, however,', 'he is quite mistaken.  His age is only so much beyond', 'hers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and', 'principles fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced,', 'is exactly the very one to make your sister happy.', 'And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour.', 'My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not', 'so handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time,', 'there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.--', \"There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby's\", 'eyes at times, which I did not like.\"', 'Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother,', 'without waiting for her assent, continued,', '\"And his manners, the Colonel\\'s manners are not only', \"more pleasing to me than Willoughby's ever were, but they\", 'are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching', 'to Marianne.

When there, at her own\", 'particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth', 'her thanks to him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon', 'was invited to visit her.', 'His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered', 'looks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately', \"held out to him, was such, as, in Elinor's conjecture,\", 'must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne,', 'or the consciousness of its being known to others;', 'and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying', 'complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable', 'recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind,', 'brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza', 'already acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye,', 'the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,', 'and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.', 'Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than', 'her daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced,', 'and therefore watching to very different effect,', \"saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what arose\", 'from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in', 'the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself', 'to think that something more than gratitude already dawned.', 'At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing', 'visibly stronger every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood,', \"urged equally by her own and her daughter's wishes,\", 'began to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER measures', 'depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could', \"not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel\", 'Brandon was soon brought, by their united request,', 'to consider his own abode there as equally determinate,', \"if not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs. Jennings's\", 'united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed', 'on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back,', 'for the better accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel,', 'at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings,', 'whose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable', 'for other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure', 'to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the course', 'of a few weeks.', 'The day of separation and departure arrived;', 'and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened', 'a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full', 'of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart', 'from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding', 'Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend,', 'was carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he', 'seemed anxious that she should engross at least half.', 'Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, and the others', 'were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers,', 'and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned', 'to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid', 'for the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon', 'immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.', 'The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne', 'bore her journey on both, without essential fatigue.', 'Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most', 'solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,', 'was the office of each watchful companion, and each', 'found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness', 'of spirits.  To Elinor, the observation of the latter', 'was particularly grateful.  She, who had seen her week', 'after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish', 'of heart which she had neither courage to speak of,', 'nor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other', 'could equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which,', 'in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection,', 'must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.', 'As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered', 'on scenes of which every field and every tree brought', 'some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent', 'and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice,', 'sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here,', 'Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw,', 'as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she', 'had been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural', 'in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,', 'and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the', 'whole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction', 'of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner', 'had they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne', 'turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness,', 'as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight', 'of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could', 'be connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed', 'at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her,', 'it never passed away without the atonement of a smile.', 'After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it;', 'but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera,', 'procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their', 'favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name', 'in his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head,', 'put the music aside, and after running over the keys', 'for a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers,', 'and closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmness', 'as she did so, that she should in future practice much.', 'The next morning produced no abatement in these', 'happy symptoms.  On the contrary, with a mind and body', 'alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with', 'more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of', \"Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party\", 'which would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits', 'and cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.', '\"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered', 'my strength,\" said she, \"we will take long walks together', 'every day.  We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down,', \"and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John's\", 'new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;', 'and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory,', 'and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told', 'they once reached.  I know we shall be happy.  I know', 'the summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to be', 'later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner', 'I shall divide every moment between music and reading.', 'I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course', 'of serious study.  Our own library is too well known to me,', 'to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement.', 'But there are many works well worth reading at the Park;', 'and there are others of more modern production which I', 'know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six', 'hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month', 'a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want.\"', 'Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated', 'so nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager', 'fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid', 'indolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing', 'excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous', 'self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she', 'remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled,', 'and feared she had that to communicate which might again', 'unsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time', 'this fair prospect of busy tranquillity.  Willing therefore', 'to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her', \"sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it.\", 'But the resolution was made only to be broken.', 'Marianne had been two or three days at home, before', 'the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself', 'to venture out.

I do not mean to talk to you', 'of what my feelings have been for him, but what they', 'are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on one point,', 'if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS', 'acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all,', 'if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked', 'as my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story', 'of that unfortunate girl\"--', 'She stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words', 'as she answered,', '\"If you could be assured of that, you think you', 'should be easy.\"', '\"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--', 'for not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has', 'been what HE has been to ME, of such designs,--but what must', 'it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine,', 'but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose', 'me to\"--', '\"How then,\" asked her sister, \"would you account', 'for his behaviour?\"', '\"I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him,', 'only fickle, very, very fickle.\"', 'Elinor said no more.  She was debating within herself', 'on the eligibility of beginning her story directly,', 'or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;--', 'and they crept on for a few minutes in silence.', '\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne', 'at last with a sigh, \"when I wish his secret reflections', 'may be no more unpleasant than my own.

My illness has made me think--', 'It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection.', 'Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly', 'able to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my', 'own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance', 'with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence', 'towards myself, and want of kindness to others.', 'I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings,', 'and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led', 'me to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been', 'entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my', 'own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.', 'Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I', 'did not know my danger till the danger was removed;', 'but with such feelings as these reflections gave me,', 'I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness', 'of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,', 'and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I died,--', 'in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse,', 'my friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful', 'selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the', 'murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR', 'remembrance!--My mother too!

Every body seemed injured by me.', 'The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings,', 'I had repaid with ungrateful contempt.  To the Middletons,', 'to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even,', 'I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened', 'against their merits, and a temper irritated by their', 'very attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them,', 'little as they deserve, I had given less than their due.', 'But you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged', 'by me.  I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;', 'yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion', 'that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was', 'before me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate', 'of you and your comfort?  Did I imitate your forbearance,', 'or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those', 'offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude', 'which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;--', 'not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I', 'had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every', 'exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow', 'to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart', 'which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you,', 'for or I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable', 'for my sake.\"', 'Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit;', 'and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest', 'to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support', 'which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved.', 'Marianne pressed her hand and replied,', '\"You are very good.--The future must be my proof.', 'I have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering', 'to it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved.', 'They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself.', 'I shall now live solely for my family.

Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.\"', '\"I know it--I know it,\" cried her mother.', '\"Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one', 'who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends,', 'and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart', 'to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her', 'sensitive conscience, would have felt all that the', 'conscience of her husband ought to have felt.\"', 'Marianne sighed, and repeated, \"I wish for no change.\"', '\"You consider the matter,\" said Elinor, \"exactly as', 'a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it;', 'and I dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only', 'in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough', 'to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you', 'in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which', 'you would have been poorly supported by an affection,', 'on his side, much less certain.  Had you married,', 'you must have been always poor.  His expensiveness is', 'acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares', 'that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him.', 'His demands and your inexperience together, on a small,', 'very small income, must have brought on distresses which', 'would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having been', 'entirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense', 'of honour and honesty would have led you, I know,', 'when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy', 'that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long', 'as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,', 'you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--', 'and how little could the utmost of your single management', 'do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?--', 'Beyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably,', 'to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead', 'of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it,', 'you would have lessened your own influence on his heart,', 'and made him regret the connection which had involved him', 'in such difficulties?\"', \"Marianne's lips quivered, and she repeated the word\", '\"Selfish?\" in a tone that implied--\"do you really think', 'him selfish?\"', '\"The whole of his behaviour,\" replied Elinor,', '\"from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been', 'grounded on selfishness.  It was selfishness which first', 'made him sport with your affections; which afterwards,', 'when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession', 'of it, and which finally carried him from Barton.', 'His own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular,', 'his ruling principle.\"', '\"It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object.\"', '\"At present,\" continued Elinor, \"he regrets what he', 'has done.  And why does he regret it?--Because he finds', 'it has not answered towards himself.  It has not made', 'him happy.  His circumstances are now unembarrassed--he', 'suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only', 'that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper', 'than yourself.  But does it follow that had he married you,', 'he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have', 'been different.  He would then have suffered under the', 'pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed,', 'he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife', 'of whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would', 'have been always necessitous--always poor; and probably', 'would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts', 'of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,', 'even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife.\"', '\"I have not a doubt of it,\" said Marianne; \"and I', 'have nothing to regret--nothing but my own folly.\"', '\"Rather say your mother\\'s imprudence, my child,\"', 'said Mrs. Dashwood; \"SHE must be answerable.\"', 'Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor,', 'satisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid', \"any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's\", 'spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject,', 'immediately continued,', '\"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from', \"the whole of the story--that all Willoughby's difficulties\", 'have arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his', 'behaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crime has been the origin', 'of every lesser one, and of all his present discontents.\"', 'Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark;', 'and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel', \"Brandon's injuries and merits, warm as friendship\", 'and design could unitedly dictate.  Her daughter did', 'not look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.', 'Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two', 'or three following days, that Marianne did not continue', 'to gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution', 'was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful', 'and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect', 'of time upon her health.', 'Margaret returned, and the family were again all', 'restored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage;', 'and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite', 'so much vigour as when they first came to Barton,', 'at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.', 'Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.', 'She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London,', 'nothing new of his plans, nothing certain even of his', 'present abode.  Some letters had passed between her', \"and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness;\", \"and in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:--\", '\"We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no', 'enquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him', 'to be still at Oxford;\" which was all the intelligence', 'of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name', 'was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.', 'She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of', 'his measures.', 'Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter', 'on business; and when, as he waited at table, he had', 'satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event', 'of his errand, this was his voluntary communication--', '\"I suppose you know, ma\\'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.\"', 'Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes', 'upon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her', 'chair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she', \"answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively taken\", \"the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's\", 'countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment', \"afterwards, alike distressed by Marianne's situation,\", 'knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention.', 'The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was', 'taken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids,', \"who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance, supported her into\", 'the other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather better,', 'and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret', 'and the maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still', 'much disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason', 'and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas,', 'as to the source of his intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwood', 'immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor', 'had the benefit of the information without the exertion', 'of seeking it.', '\"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?\"', '\"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma\\'am, this morning', 'in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was.  They was', 'stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn,', 'as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park', 'to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened', 'to look up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly', 'it was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat,', 'and she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you,', \"ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne,\", \"and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's,\", 'their best compliments and service, and how sorry they', 'was they had not time to come on and see you, but they was', 'in a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further', 'down for a little while, but howsever, when they come back,', 'they\\'d make sure to come and see you.\"', '\"But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?\"', '\"Yes, ma\\'am. She smiled, and said how she', 'had changed her name since she was in these parts.', 'She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady,', 'and very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her joy.\"', '\"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?\"', '\"Yes, ma\\'am, I just see him leaning back in it,', 'but he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much', 'for talking.\"', \"Elinor's heart could easily account for his not\", 'putting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably', 'found the same explanation.', '\"Was there no one else in the carriage?\"', '\"No, ma\\'am, only they two.\"', '\"Do you know where they came from?\"', '\"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--', 'Mrs. Ferrars told me.\"', '\"And are they going farther westward?\"', '\"Yes, ma\\'am--but not to bide long.  They will soon', 'be back again, and then they\\'d be sure and call here.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter;', 'but Elinor knew better than to expect them.', 'She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and was', 'very confident that Edward would never come near them.', 'She observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they', \"were probably going down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.\", \"Thomas's intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked\", 'as if she wished to hear more.', '\"Did you see them off, before you came away?\"', '\"No, ma\\'am--the horses were just coming out, but I', 'could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late.\"', '\"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?\"', '\"Yes, ma\\'am, she said how she was very well;', 'and to my mind she was always a very handsome young', 'lady--and she seemed vastly contented.\"', 'Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question,', 'and Thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless,', 'were soon afterwards dismissed.  Marianne had already sent', \"to say, that she should eat nothing more.  Mrs. Dashwood's\", \"and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret\", 'might think herself very well off, that with so much', 'uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced,', 'so much reason as they had often had to be careless', 'of their meals, she had never been obliged to go without', 'her dinner before.', 'When the dessert and the wine were arranged,', 'and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves,', 'they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness', 'and silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark,', 'and ventured not to offer consolation.  She now found', \"that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation\", 'of herself; and justly concluded that every thing', 'had been expressly softened at the time, to spare her', 'from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then', 'had suffered for Marianne.  She found that she had been', 'misled by the careful, the considerate attention of', 'her daughter, to think the attachment, which once she', 'had so well understood, much slighter in reality, than', 'she had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved', 'to be.  She feared that under this persuasion she had', 'been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;--', \"that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged,\", 'more immediately before her, had too much engrossed', 'her tenderness, and led her away to forget that in Elinor', 'she might have a daughter suffering almost as much,', 'certainly with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.', 'CHAPTER 48', 'Elinor now found the difference between the expectation', 'of an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told', 'to consider it, and certainty itself.  She now found, that', 'in spite of herself, she had always admitted a hope,', 'while Edward remained single, that something would occur', 'to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of', 'his own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible', 'opportunity of establishment for the lady, would arise', 'to assist the happiness of all.  But he was now married;', 'and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery,', 'which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.', 'That he should be married soon, before (as she imagined)', 'he could be in orders, and consequently before he could', 'be in possession of the living, surprised her a little', 'at first.  But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy,', 'in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him,', 'should overlook every thing but the risk of delay.', 'They were married, married in town, and now hastening', \"down to her uncle's.  What had Edward felt on being within\", \"four miles from Barton, on seeing her mother's servant,\", \"on hearing Lucy's message!\", 'They would soon, she supposed, be settled at', 'Delaford.--Delaford,--that place in which so much', 'conspired to give her an interest; which she wished', 'to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.', 'She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw', 'in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once', 'a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality,', 'and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;--', 'pursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the', 'favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every', 'wealthy friend.  In Edward--she knew not what she saw,', 'nor what she wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing', 'pleased her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.', 'Elinor flattered herself that some one of their', 'connections in London would write to them to announce', 'the event, and give farther particulars,--but day after', 'day passed off, and brought no letter, no tidings.', 'Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found', 'fault with every absent friend.  They were all thoughtless', 'or indolent.', '\"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma\\'am?\"', 'was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience', 'of her mind to have something going on.', '\"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather', 'expect to see, than to hear from him again.  I earnestly', 'pressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised', 'to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.\"', 'This was gaining something, something to look forward to.', 'Colonel Brandon must have some information to give.', 'Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure', 'of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window.', 'He stopt at their gate.  It was a gentleman, it', 'was Colonel Brandon himself.  Now she could hear more;', 'and she trembled in expectation of it.  But--it was', 'NOT Colonel Brandon--neither his air--nor his height.', 'Were it possible, she must say it must be Edward.', 'She looked again.  He had just dismounted;--she could not be', 'mistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She moved away and sat down.', '\"He comes from Mr. Pratt\\'s purposely to see us.  I WILL be', 'calm; I WILL be mistress of myself.\"', 'In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise', 'aware of the mistake.  She saw her mother and Marianne', 'change colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper', 'a few sentences to each other.  She would have given', 'the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand', 'that she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear', 'in their behaviour to him;--but she had no utterance,', 'and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion.', 'Not a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited', 'in silence for the appearance of their visitor.', 'His footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment', 'he was in the passage, and in another he was before them.', 'His countenance, as he entered the room, was not', 'too happy, even for Elinor.  His complexion was white', 'with agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his', 'reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.', 'Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted,', 'to the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant', 'in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing,', 'met with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand,', 'and wished him joy.', 'He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.', \"Elinor's lips had moved with her mother's, and, when the\", 'moment of action was over, she wished that she had shaken', 'hands with him too.  But it was then too late, and with a', 'countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again', 'and talked of the weather.', 'Marianne had retreated as much as possible', 'out of sight, to conceal her distress; and Margaret,', 'understanding some part, but not the whole of the case,', 'thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore', 'took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained', 'a strict silence.', 'When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness', 'of the season, a very awful pause took place.  It was put', 'an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged to hope that he', 'had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In a hurried manner,', 'he replied in the affirmative.', 'Another pause.', 'Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing', 'the sound of her own voice, now said,', '\"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?\"', '\"At Longstaple!\" he replied, with an air of surprise.--', '\"No, my mother is in town.\"', '\"I meant,\" said Elinor, taking up some work from', 'the table, \"to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.\"', 'She dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both', 'turned their eyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed,', 'looked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,--', '\"Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs.', 'ROBERT Ferrars.\"', '\"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!\"--was repeated by Marianne and her', 'mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though', 'Elinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on him', 'with the same impatient wonder.  He rose from his seat,', 'and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing', 'what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there,', 'and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting', 'the latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,', '\"Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard', 'that my brother is lately married to--to the youngest--to', 'Miss Lucy Steele.\"', 'His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment', 'by all but Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over', 'her work, in a state of such agitation as made her hardly', 'know where she was.', '\"Yes,\" said he, \"they were married last week,', 'and are now at Dawlish.\"', 'Elinor could sit it no longer.  She almost ran', 'out of the room, and as soon as the door was closed,', 'burst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would', 'never cease.  Edward, who had till then looked any where,', 'rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--', 'or even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards', 'he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries,', 'no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate,', 'and at last, without saying a word, quitted the room,', 'and walked out towards the village--leaving the others', 'in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change', 'in his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity', 'which they had no means of lessening but by their', 'own conjectures.', 'CHAPTER 49', 'Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his', 'release might appear to the whole family, it was certain', 'that Edward was free; and to what purpose that freedom would', 'be employed was easily pre-determined by all;--for after', 'experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement,', \"contracted without his mother's consent, as he had already\", 'done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected', 'of him in the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction', 'of another.', 'His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.', 'It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering', 'that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question,', 'it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable', 'in the present case as he really did, so much in need of', 'encouragement and fresh air.', 'How soon he had walked himself into the proper', 'resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising', 'it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself,', 'and how he was received, need not be particularly told.', 'This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to', \"table at four o'clock, about three hours after his arrival,\", \"he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent,\", 'and was not only in the rapturous profession of', 'the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth,', 'one of the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was', 'more than commonly joyful.  He had more than the ordinary', 'triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise', 'his spirits.  He was released without any reproach', 'to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed', 'his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--', 'and elevated at once to that security with another,', 'which he must have thought of almost with despair,', 'as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire.', 'He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from', 'misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken', 'in such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness,', 'as his friends had never witnessed in him before.', 'His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses,', 'all its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment', 'to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.', '\"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\"', 'said he, \"the consequence of ignorance of the world--', 'and want of employment.  Had my brother given me', 'some active profession when I was removed at eighteen', 'from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure,', 'it would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple', 'with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable', 'preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit,', 'any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance', 'from her for a few months, I should very soon have', 'outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing', 'more with the world, as in such case I must have done.', 'But instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any', 'profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself,', 'I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first', 'twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment,', 'which belonging to the university would have given me;', 'for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen.', 'I had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy', 'myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home', 'in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend,', 'no companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance,', 'it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple,', 'where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure', 'of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part', 'of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared', 'everything that was amiable and obliging.  She was pretty', 'too--at least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little', 'of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see', 'no defects.  Considering everything, therefore, I hope,', 'foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since', 'in every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural', 'or an inexcusable piece of folly.\"', 'The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds', 'and the happiness of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as', 'promised them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night.', 'Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how', 'to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how to be enough', 'thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,', 'nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained', 'conversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished,', 'the sight and society of both.', 'Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.', 'Comparisons would occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy,', 'though sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to', 'give her neither spirits nor language.', 'But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From', 'the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another,', 'that Edward was free, to the moment of his justifying', 'the hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every', 'thing by turns but tranquil.

Though his eyes had been long opened,', 'even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her', 'ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions--', 'they had been equally imputed, by him, to her want', 'of education; and till her last letter reached him,', 'he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,', 'good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.', 'Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented', 'his putting an end to an engagement, which, long before', \"the discovery of it laid him open to his mother's anger,\", 'had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.', '\"I thought it my duty,\" said he, \"independent of my feelings,', 'to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not,', 'when I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all', 'appearance without a friend in the world to assist me.', 'In such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing', 'to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature,', 'how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted', 'on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing', 'but the most disinterested affection was her inducement?', 'And even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted,', 'or what fancied advantage it could be to her, to be', 'fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard,', 'and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.', 'She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a', 'living.\"', '\"No; but she might suppose that something would occur', 'in your favour; that your own family might in time relent.', 'And at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing the engagement,', 'for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination', 'nor her actions.  The connection was certainly a', 'respectable one, and probably gained her consideration among', 'her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred,', 'it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single.\"', 'Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that', \"nothing could have been more natural than Lucy's conduct,\", 'nor more self-evident than the motive of it.', 'Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold', 'the imprudence which compliments themselves, for having', 'spent so much time with them at Norland, when he must', 'have felt his own inconstancy.', '\"Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,\" said she;', '\"because--to say nothing of my own conviction, our relations', 'were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT, as you', 'were THEN situated, could never be.\"', 'He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart,', 'and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement.', '\"I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH', 'was plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being', 'with you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was', 'to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour.  I felt', 'that I admired you, but I told myself it was only friendship;', 'and till I began to make comparisons between yourself', 'and Lucy, I did not know how far I was got.  After that,', 'I suppose, I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex,', 'and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the', 'expediency of it, were no better than these:--The danger', 'is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself.\"', 'Elinor smiled, and shook her head.', \"Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's\", 'being expected at the Cottage, as he really wished', 'not only to be better acquainted with him, but to have an', 'opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented', 'his giving him the living of Delaford--\"Which, at present,\"', 'said he, \"after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine', 'were on the occasion, he must think I have never forgiven', 'him for offering.\"', 'NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet', 'been to the place.  But so little interest had be taken', 'in the matter, that he owed all his knowledge of the house,', 'garden, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of', 'the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself,', 'who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon,', 'and heard it with so much attention, as to be entirely', 'mistress of the subject.', 'One question after this only remained undecided,', 'between them, one difficulty only was to be overcome.', 'They were brought together by mutual affection,', 'with the warmest approbation of their real friends;', 'their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make', 'their happiness certain--and they only wanted something', 'to live upon.  Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor', 'one, which, with Delaford living, was all that they could', 'call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood', 'should advance anything; and they were neither of them', 'quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty', 'pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life.', 'Edward was not entirely without hopes of some', 'favourable change in his mother towards him; and on THAT', 'he rested for the residue of their income.  But Elinor', 'had no such dependence; for since Edward would still', 'be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself', \"had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language\", 'as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele,', \"she feared that Robert's offence would serve no other\", 'purpose than to enrich Fanny.', \"About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel\", \"Brandon appeared, to complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction,\", 'and to give her the dignity of having, for the first time', 'since her living at Barton, more company with her than', 'her house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the', 'privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore', 'walked every night to his old quarters at the Park;', 'from whence he usually returned in the morning, early enough', \"to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a-tete before breakfast.\", \"A three weeks' residence at Delaford, where,\", 'in his evening hours at least, he had little to do', 'but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six', 'and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind', \"which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks,\", 'all the kindness of her welcome, and all the encouragement', \"of her mother's language, to make it cheerful.\", 'Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive.', \"No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew\", 'nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his', 'visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.', 'Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood,', 'and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done', 'for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest', 'of Elinor.', 'It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced', 'in the good opinion of each other, as they advanced in each', \"other's acquaintance, for it could not be otherwise.\", 'Their resemblance in good principles and good sense,', 'in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably', 'have been sufficient to unite them in friendship,', 'without any other attraction; but their being in love', 'with two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other,', 'made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,', 'which might otherwise have waited the effect of time', 'and judgment.', 'The letters from town, which a few days before would', \"have made every nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport,\", 'now arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth.', 'Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her', 'honest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour forth', 'her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure,', 'had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now,', 'by all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.--', '\"I do think,\" she continued, \"nothing was ever carried', 'on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called', 'and sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul suspected', 'anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!', 'came crying to me the day after, in a great fright', 'for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to', 'get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her', 'money before she went off to be married, on purpose', 'we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not', 'seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give', 'her five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she', 'thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess,', 'in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again.', \"And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them\", 'along with them in the chaise is worse than all.', 'Poor Mr. Edward!

Neither of them were\", 'ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even,', 'if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son,', 'his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter,', 'nor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy', 'with which everything had been carried on between them,', 'was rationally treated as enormously heightening', 'the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred', 'to the others, proper measures would have been taken', 'to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join', \"with him in regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward\", 'had not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus', 'be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--', 'He thus continued:', '\"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward\\'s name,', 'which does not surprise us; but, to our great astonishment,', 'not a line has been received from him on the occasion.', 'Perhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending,', 'and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line', 'to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter', 'of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny,', 'and by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss;', \"for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars's heart,\", 'and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms', 'with her children.\"', 'This paragraph was of some importance to the', 'prospects and conduct of Edward.

With apprehensive caution', 'therefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with', 'unexpected calmness.  Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably', 'endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood,', 'by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss Morton', 'he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--', 'and enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton', 'was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds,', 'while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private', 'gentleman with no more than THREE; but when she found that,', 'though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation,', 'he was by no means inclined to be guided by it,', 'she judged it wisest, from the experience of the past,', 'to submit--and therefore, after such an ungracious delay', 'as she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent', 'every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree', 'of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.', 'What she would engage to do towards augmenting', 'their income was next to be considered; and here it', 'plainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son,', 'he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was', 'inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year,', \"not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking\", 'orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost;', 'nor was anything promised either for the present or in future,', 'beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny.', 'It was as much, however, as was desired,', 'and more than was expected, by Edward and Elinor;', 'and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,', 'seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.', 'With an income quite sufficient to their wants', 'thus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for', 'after Edward was in possession of the living, but the', 'readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon,', 'with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor,', 'was making considerable improvements; and after waiting', 'some time for their completion, after experiencing,', 'as usual, a thousand disappointments and delays', 'from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,', 'as usual, broke through the first positive resolution', 'of not marrying till every thing was ready, and the', 'ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn.', 'The first month after their marriage was spent', 'with their friend at the Mansion-house; from whence', 'they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage,', 'and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--', 'could chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.', \"Mrs. Jennings's prophecies, though rather jumbled together,\", 'were chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward', 'and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she', 'found in Elinor and her husband, as she really believed,', 'one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had', 'in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel', 'Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for', 'their cows.', 'They were visited on their first settling by almost', 'all their relations and friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came', 'to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed', 'of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at', 'the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.', '\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\"', 'said John, as they were walking together one morning before', 'the gates of Delaford House, \"THAT would be saying too much,', 'for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young', 'women in the world, as it is.  But, I confess, it would', 'give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother.', 'His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in', 'such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I', 'have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there', 'is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps,', 'Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him--', 'yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to', 'have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel', 'Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what', 'may happen--for, when people are much thrown together,', 'and see little of anybody else--and it will always be', 'in your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;--', 'in short, you may as well give her a chance--You understand', 'me.\"--', 'But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always', 'treated them with the make-believe of decent affection,', 'they were never insulted by her real favour and preference.', 'THAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning', 'of his wife; and it was earned by them before many months', 'had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter,', 'which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape,', 'was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it;', 'for her respectful humility, assiduous attentions,', 'and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening', 'was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars', 'to his choice, and re-established him completely in', 'her favour.', \"The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair,\", 'and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held', 'forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest,', 'an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress', 'may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every', 'advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time', 'and conscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance,', \"and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings,\", 'it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother.', 'He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;', 'and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection', 'of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews', 'would settle the matter.  In that point, however,', 'and that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him', 'hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME,', 'another visit, another conversation, was always wanted', 'to produce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered', 'in her mind when they parted, which could only be', \"removed by another half hour's discourse with himself.\", 'His attendance was by this means secured, and the rest', 'followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward,', 'they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject', 'on which he had always more to say than on any other,', 'and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal', 'to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident', 'to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.', 'He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward,', 'and very proud of marrying privately without his', \"mother's consent.  What immediately followed is known.\", 'They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish;', 'for she had many relations and old acquaintances to', 'cut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--', 'and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness', 'of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it,', \"which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted.  The forgiveness,\", 'at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert;', 'and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore', 'could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks', 'longer unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct', \"and messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence,\", 'and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with,', 'procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame', 'her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid', 'degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.', 'Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert', 'or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven', 'for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor,', 'though superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken', 'of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered,', 'and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.', 'They settled in town, received very liberal assistance', 'from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable', 'with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies', 'and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,', 'in which their husbands of course took a part, as well', 'as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and', 'Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which', 'they all lived together.', 'What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest', 'son, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what', 'Robert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them', 'still more.  It was an arrangement, however, justified in', 'its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever', \"appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give\", 'a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income,', 'as either leaving his brother too little, or bringing', 'himself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from', 'the ready discharge of his duties in every particular,', 'from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,', 'and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits,', 'he might be supposed no less contented with his lot,', 'no less free from every wish of an exchange.', \"Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her\", 'family as could well be contrived, without rendering', 'the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother', 'and sisters spent much more than half their time with her.', 'Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well', 'as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford;', 'for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together', 'was hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than', 'what John had expressed.  It was now her darling object.', 'Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,', 'she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant', 'enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at', 'the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.', 'They each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations,', 'and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward', 'of all.', 'With such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge', 'so intimate of his goodness--with a conviction of his fond', 'attachment to herself, which at last, though long after it', 'was observable to everybody else--burst on her--what could she', 'do?', 'Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.', 'She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions,', 'and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims.', 'She was born to overcome an affection formed so late', 'in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment', 'superior to strong esteem and lively friendship,', 'voluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other,', 'a man who had suffered no less than herself under the', 'event of a former attachment, whom, two years before,', 'she had considered too old to be married,--and who still', 'sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!', 'But so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice', 'to an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly', 'flattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining', 'even for ever with her mother, and finding her only', 'pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her', 'more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,--', 'she found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments,', 'entering on new duties, placed in a new home, a wife,', 'the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.', 'Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best', 'loved him, believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he', 'was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her', 'society restored his mind to animation, and his spirits', 'to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness', 'in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight', 'of each observing friend.  Marianne could never love', 'by halves; and her whole heart became, in time, as much', 'devoted to her husband, as it had once been to Willoughby.', 'Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without', 'a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete', 'in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating', 'his marriage with a woman of character, as the source', 'of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he', 'behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have', 'been happy and rich.  That his repentance of misconduct,', 'which thus brought its own punishment, was sincere,', 'need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel', 'Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But that', 'he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society,', 'or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a', 'broken heart, must not be depended on--for he did neither.', 'He lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself.', 'His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home', 'always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,', 'and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable', 'degree of domestic felicity.', 'For Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility', 'in surviving her loss--he always retained that decided', 'regard which interested him in every thing that befell her,', 'and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;--', 'and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in', 'after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.', 'Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage,', 'without attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for', 'Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them,', 'Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing,', 'and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover.', 'Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant', 'communication which strong family affection would', 'naturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness', 'of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked as the least', 'considerable, that though sisters, and living almost within', 'sight of each other, they could live without disagreement', 'between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.', 'THE END']\n"
